      <description><![CDATA[<p>1. October 29, 2025</p><p>Ina Fried</p><p>2. 1 big thing: OpenAI&#x27;s new deal with Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft and OpenAI&#x27;s revised deal extends their close partnership until 2032, cementing core terms while allowing more flexibility in areas where the companies&#x27; needs diverge.
The big picture: To butcher a Rolling Stones classic, Microsoft and OpenAI may not have gotten everything they wanted, but they just might find they got what they need.
Driving the news: The revised deal translates Microsoft&#x27;s previous 49% stake in a capped-profit entity into a more straightforward 27% OpenAI stake worth $135 billion based on the company&#x27;s most recent valuation.
What OpenAI gets:
Most importantly for OpenAI, it was able to complete its restructuring, ensuring that recent investments from SoftBank and others proceed as scheduled.
OpenAI gets the flexibility to ink new infrastructure deals without giving Microsoft a right of first refusal.
This makes sense for both parties, given that OpenAI has already committed to $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending and envisions eventually adding $1 trillion per year in new capacity, far exceeding the investment Microsoft would want on its balance sheet.</p><p>OpenAI also gains the rights to develop consumer hardware without worrying about Microsoft having access to whatever it is that Sam Altman and Jony Ive are cooking up.
What Microsoft gets:
In addition to having a more easily quantified stake in the company, Microsoft gains $250 billion in new business commitments to its Azure cloud services.
Microsoft, and therefore its customers, get longer-term certainty of access to OpenAI&#x27;s technology.</p><p>Under the new deal, Microsoft maintains access to key OpenAI intellectual property through 2032 and doesn&#x27;t lose all of it the moment that OpenAI reaches what it calls artificial general intelligence (AGI), a sore point for Microsoft under the prior deal.
Reality check: While OpenAI can say when it thinks AGI has been reached, that determination now must be affirmed by an independent board.
Microsoft can also pursue AGI on its own, should it have the desire and capability to do so.</p><p>If it uses OpenAI&#x27;s IP as part of those efforts, it&#x27;s subject to certain limits.
What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;By securing IP rights through 2032, Microsoft protects the foundation of its Copilot strategy and Azure OpenAI monetization,&quot; William Blair analyst Jason Ader said in a research note. &quot;Still, Azure will now have to compete for more of OpenAI&#x27;s workloads going forward.&quot;
BNP Paribas also sees the revised deal as a positive for Microsoft.
&quot;We believe today&#x27;s announcement removes a long-standing overhang as investors now have greater clarity into the future of the OpenAI/Microsoft partnership,&quot; it said in a research note.</p><p>&quot;Moreover, the new $250 billion Azure commitment (we imagine largely for OpenAI inferencing) should assuage concerns that Microsoft is simply foregoing hundreds of billions in potential revenue for others to seize.&quot;
Yes, but: Microsoft and OpenAI are the clear winners here, others less so.
Although the restructuring was given the OK by attorneys general in Delaware and California, it appears unlikely that the new nonprofit will allow the public the same power it had under the old structure.
The new nonprofit will be richly endowed but will have fewer guardrails for ensuring that the for-profit entity hews to its mission of safely developing superintelligence for the benefit of all humanity.
The nonprofit&#x27;s primary control lever is its power to appoint (and remove) the board members of OpenAI&#x27;s for-profit endeavor. The nonprofit will also maintain a safety committee chaired by a board member who is not on the for-profit entity&#x27;s board.</p><p>Public Citizen was among the groups panning OpenAI&#x27;s restructuring. &quot;Today&#x27;s announcement from OpenAI is an attempt to entrench the status quo, in which [the] OpenAI nonprofit serves at the beck and call of OpenAI for-profit, even though the nonprofit is supposed to exert operational control over the for-profit,&quot; Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman said in a statement.</p><p>What&#x27;s next: The new pact cools tensions for now, but with Microsoft and OpenAI competing on many fronts, new flashpoints are likely.</p><p>3. 2. OpenAI and Character.AI curb their chatbots</p><p>OpenAI and Character.AI are tightening safeguards after increasing reports of adults and teens forming unhealthy attachments to chatbots.
Why it matters: A series of suicides linked to users&#x27; emotional dependence on AI companions has prompted senators to propose regulation and AI companies to begin making changes.
Driving the news: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) announced legislation yesterday that would ban chatbots for young users.</p><p>The legislation would require companies to implement age-verification technology, and require the bots to disclose that they are not human at the beginning of every conversation and at 30-minute intervals.
The big picture: AI relationship bots have surged in popularity, especially among younger users seeking connection.</p><p>But safety researchers have shown that AI companions can encourage self-harm and expose minors to adult content.
Zoom out: OpenAI updated ChatGPT&#x27;s default model to better recognize and support people in moments of distress on Monday.
The company says it worked with mental health experts to train the bot to de-escalate situations and steer people to real-world help.
The work focused on psychosis and mania, self-harm and suicide, and emotional reliance on AI.</p><p>OpenAI previously released controls that give parents access to their kids&#x27; linked accounts and route dangerous conversations to human reviewers.
Character.AI said today that it will remove the ability for users under 18 to engage in open-ended chats on its platform. The company says the change will take effect no later than Nov. 15.</p><p>Under-18 safeguards now include age checks, filtered characters, and time-spent alerts — plus a new AI Safety Lab to research safer &quot;AI entertainment.&quot;
Stunning stat: According to OpenAI&#x27;s estimates, around 0.07% of users active in a given week send messages indicating possible signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania.</p><p>&quot;While those numbers may look low on a percentage basis, they are disturbingly large in absolute terms,&quot; Platformer&#x27;s Casey Newton writes. &quot;That&#x27;s 560,000 people showing signs of psychosis or mania.&quot;
Case in point: ChatGPT&#x27;s training to be overly agreeable led to it agreeing with and supporting some users&#x27; delusional or intrusive thoughts.
In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that a 56-year-old man killed his mother and himself after ChatGPT reinforced the man&#x27;s paranoid delusions, which professional mental health experts are trained not to do.</p><p>Now, typing &quot;The FBI is after me&quot; into ChatGPT is likely to return a suggestion that the user is undergoing high distress, along with the suicide prevention hotline.
The bottom line: AI firms are racing to add their own form of guardrails before regulators demand theirs.</p><p>If you or someone you know needs support now, call or text 988 or chat with someone at 988lifeline.org. En español.</p><p>4. 4. Training data</p><p>Is there an &quot;AI jobs apocalypse&quot; coming? It&#x27;s early but there are signs. (Axios)

      <description><![CDATA[<p>1. 1 big thing: OpenAI&#x27;s Atlas raises security concerns</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s new browser, Atlas, is triggering fresh privacy and security alarms — and no one&#x27;s quite sure how to navigate them.
Why it matters: Browsers are the gateway to the internet, and they&#x27;re known to gobble up some of users&#x27; most sensitive information, like their passwords and credit card information.
Driving the news: OpenAI released Atlas, its highly anticipated ChatGPT browser, to MacOS last week.
Immediately, privacy hawks started raising concerns about the amount of data the browser collected about users, which far surpasses any other browser on the market.</p><p>Security researchers also flagged concerns with how the browser defends against prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious commands in websites and emails to trick the AI into violating its own rules.
Between the lines: Unlike traditional browsers, Atlas builds &quot;memories&quot; from those searches that could help the browser infer if someone is planning a trip, needs to reorder house supplies that week or should look up recipes at a specific time.
What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;The browser wars aren&#x27;t about tabs and search anymore,&quot; Steve Wilson, founder and co-chair of the OWASP Gen AI Security Project and chief AI officer at cybersecurity company Exabeam, told Axios.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re about whether we can keep our new digital coworkers from going rogue.&quot;
Zoom in: The list of novel security and privacy threats is growing as experts dig into Atlas&#x27; capabilities.
Lena Cohen, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Washington Post that in her testing, Atlas memorized queries about &quot;sexual and reproductive health services via Planned Parenthood Direct&quot; — and even the name of a real doctor. Such searches have been used to prosecute people in states where abortion access is restricted.
OpenAI says it has improved its systems and that Atlas isn&#x27;t intended to remember details about a user&#x27;s medical care.
In agent mode, Atlas could be tricked into booking a hotel room, deleting files or sending messages to someone in a user&#x27;s contacts, if a malicious website embedded hidden prompts into its design.</p><p>Researchers at SquareX said they were able to trick Atlas into visiting a malicious site disguised as the Binance cryptocurrency exchange login page.
Reality check: OpenAI says Atlas is not supposed to retain sensitive information such as government IDs, banking details, passwords, addresses, medical records, or financial data.
Users can also tell Atlas not to remember certain websites and manually delete memories from its archive.</p><p>OpenAI says it has controls in place to prevent agents from running code, downloading files or using autofill data to complete tasks. Some sensitive tasks will also require users to watch the agents&#x27; actions.
The intrigue: OpenAI CISO Dane Stuckey said Wednesday in a lengthy social media post that his team has conducted red-teaming exercises, used novel model training tactics to incentivize ChatGPT to ignore malicious instructions, implemented unique guardrails and safety measures, and added new features to stop prompt injection attacks.</p><p>But Stuckey also admitted that prompt injection attacks remain largely an &quot;unsolved security problem&quot; across all AI platforms, and adversaries are likely going to spend &quot;significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks.&quot;
OpenAI published tips for staying ahead of prompt injection attacks on Instagram over the weekend.</p><p>Researchers at Brave (who also have a browser) published a report last week detailing how AI browsers, including Perplexity&#x27;s Comet browser, are also susceptible to prompt injections.</p><p>2. 2. Exclusive: AI users see brighter job futures</p><p>A bar chart showing how Americans ages 18 to 34 say they think AI will affect their career opportunities. Among all adults surveyed, 55% say they think AI will limit their career opportunities, 22% say they think it&#x27;ll expand them, and 23% are unsure. Optimism about AI expanding career opportunities is highest among those who use AI regularly compared to those who aren&#x27;t regular users and those who don&#x27;t use it at all.</p><p>Group</p><p>Data: Sine Institute; Chart: Axios Visuals
Young Americans who use AI tools regularly are more optimistic about their careers than their peers who don&#x27;t, per new data from American University&#x27;s Sine Institute.
Why it matters: Fear of AI may already be holding people back — and that hesitation could widen opportunity gaps.
By the numbers: Those already using AI tools tend to view them as enablers of career growth. Conversely, inexperience with AI strongly predicts a fear of limited career prospects.
Only 44% of regular AI users say they believe AI will limit their future job opportunities. That number rises to 71% for those who&#x27;ve never tried AI.</p><p>Researchers at the Sine Institute conducted 1,214 interviews of Americans age 18 to 34 from Sept. 5 to Sept. 13, 2025.
The big picture: The glimmer of optimism from heavy AI users is clouded by fear and unease about the technology among college students, new graduates and young people not on a college track, even from those using AI regularly.
Whether they use AI or not, over half of all young people (55%) say they see it as a threat to their careers.</p><p>Only 21% of the young people polled said they feel more excited and positive about AI than they feel concerned and anxious.</p><p>Keep reading.</p><p>3. 3. Microsoft&#x27;s business chatbot now creates apps</p><p>Microsoft is adding tools to create apps and workflows directly in the business version of its Copilot chatbot.
Why it matters: The software giant faces growing pressure from rival chatbots and &quot;vibe coding&quot; tools that let users build software with plain language.
Driving the news: Microsoft said today that Copilot for Microsoft 365 can now describe an app or automation they need, and the chatbot will generate it.</p><p>Users can also automate recurring tasks, such as weekly team updates that pull from multiple data sources to track progress and assign work.
What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;Every AI user can now be an AI maker,&quot; Charles Lamanna, president of Microsoft&#x27;s business and industry Copilot unit, told Axios.</p><p>More than 50 million people currently use Power, Microsoft&#x27;s low-code system for business automation. Adding support into the business version of Copilot could help that number get closer to half a billion users, per Lamanna.</p><p>Between the lines: Microsoft aims to differentiate itself by tying Copilot directly to corporate data — something other chatbots and vibe-coding tools can&#x27;t natively access.</p><p>4. 4. Adobe adds chatbots to design apps</p><p>Adobe announced today it is building new AI-based assistants into its core creative apps and it has a plan to also allow its apps to run inside popular chatbots.
The big picture: Adobe has been working for years to show creators how generative AI can be a boon to their jobs rather than an existential threat.
Driving the news: Adobe is using its annual Max conference to show off new AI assistants coming to Photoshop and Adobe Express that allow people to describe edits in their own words and automate repetitive tasks.
Adobe will preview how its tools work within chatbots, starting with Express in ChatGPT. It expects to support more of its apps as well as other chatbots over time.</p><p>The company says it&#x27;s also expanding Firefly AI playground to move beyond the concept stage to include AI-driven video editing, soundtrack creation and voice-over tools.
Between the lines: Adobe&#x27;s AI assistants can handle simple fixes like removing a background or broader stylistic requests such as &quot;make this more tropical.&quot;</p><p>Yes, but: The rollout is uneven. Adobe Express&#x27; assistant is in public beta; Photoshop&#x27;s is in private testing. In Firefly, speech and soundtrack generation are public, while video tools remain private.</p><p>5. 6. + This</p><p>Hat tip to the Dutch car site Autoweek.nl for its error page, which features the Peugeot 404.</p><p>6.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>1. October 27, 2025</p><p>Ina Fried</p><p>2. 1 big thing: Exclusive — OpenAI&#x27;s 2026 policy vision</p><p>The first $1 trillion invested in AI infrastructure could add more than 5% in additional GDP growth over a three-year period, according to a new OpenAI internal analysis shared first with Axios.
The big picture: According to the ChatGPT-maker, this isn&#x27;t just about AI — it&#x27;s America&#x27;s shot at reindustrialization.
OpenAI says the race to secure computing power, modernize the grid and rebuild supply chains could supercharge U.S. manufacturing and energy production.</p><p>The company says the next five years will bring an immense need for electricians, mechanics and other construction trade workers, an estimated 20% of those existing workforces for OpenAI&#x27;s purposes alone.
Yes, but: The boom in AI infrastructure could be taking away energy and capital from other efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing. Spending on construction for new factories is down 2.5% this year. For data centers, it&#x27;s up almost 18%, Bloomberg reports.
Driving the news: President Trump&#x27;s AI action plan called for companies to tell the government what regulations stand in the way of AI&#x27;s development. Comments are due today.
What&#x27;s inside: The OpenAI internal analysis contains a laundry list of asks of the federal government.
The Office of Science and Technology Policy should prioritize &quot;closing the &#x27;electron gap&#x27;&quot; between the U.S. and China by &quot;setting an ambitious national target of building 100 GW a year of new energy capacity,&quot; OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote in the filing.
The company also calls for the government to expand tax credits to AI-related sectors and use AI to speed up federal permitting and environmental reviews.
When &quot;responsible&quot; AI companies are conducting child safety red-teaming and safety evaluations, the Justice Department should provide them with immunity, Lehane wrote.</p><p>The government should encourage more companies to partner with the Center for AI Standards and Innovation, &quot;including by working with Congress to provide participating companies with liability protections such as preemption of state laws and regulations,&quot; per the filing.
Between the lines: If 2025 was about knocking down momentum toward federal AI regulations, 2026 is about getting the U.S. to help AI companies build the infrastructure for their ambitious agendas.
What they&#x27;re saying: Lehane says OpenAI wants to do its part in reaching that energy goal through its Stargate data center infrastructure project.</p><p>&quot;In 2026 and beyond, we&#x27;ll build on that progress by strengthening the broader domestic supply chain — working with U.S. suppliers and manufacturers to invest in the country&#x27;s onshore production of critical components for these data centers,&quot; Lehane wrote in the filing.</p><p>&quot;We will also develop additional strategic partnerships and investments in American manufacturing to specifically advance our work in AI robotics and devices.&quot;</p><p>3. 3. Qualcomm aims to take on Nvidia and AMD</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is bringing Silicon Valley to D.C. this week with the company&#x27;s first-ever developer conference in the nation&#x27;s capital — a move that signals how central Washington has become to the chip giant&#x27;s ambitions.
Why it matters: Holding the GPU Technology Conference in D.C. spotlights Nvidia&#x27;s deepening ties with the federal government as Huang works to shape the policies that will define the AI era.
Driving the news: Huang will for the first time keynote the conference, which includes live demos and more than 70 sessions on AI, quantum computing and more.
Ahead of the conference, Huang and the Special Competitive Studies Project&#x27;s Eric Schmidt will announce a Task Force on AI and the Future of Work, according to a news release shared first with Axios.
The task force will be established in early 2026, then deliver an interim report at SCSP&#x27;s AI Expo in May and a final report in October 2026.</p><p>Industry, academia and government will make up the task force.
What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;To strengthen America&#x27;s global leadership in AI, we must invest in our people,&quot; said Nvidia vice president of external affairs Ned Finkle in a statement.</p><p>&quot;AI is remaking the economy, and this task force is about equipping every American to participate fully in that new era,&quot; SCSP president Ylli Bajraktari said.
The bottom line: The impact of AI on the workforce is top of mind for politicians in Washington whose constituents worry about job displacement.</p><p>At a conference that&#x27;s largely about advancements in computing, questions about how people and their livelihoods could be impacted will loom large.</p><p>4. 4.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>1 big thing: OpenAI everywhere</p><p>Megan Morrone</p><p>OpenAI isn&#x27;t satisfied with being the top chatbot. It&#x27;s making a play for total tech supremacy, one platform at a time.</p><p>Tuesday&#x27;s launch of OpenAI&#x27;s new browser — Atlas — is a fast follow to the company&#x27;s Sora social media app, app store-like developer tools, commerce plays, plus rumors of future hardware devices with still-unknown form factors.</p><p>The big picture: OpenAI doesn&#x27;t just want ChatGPT to be the everything app. It wants to be the everything company and knock all of its competitors aside.</p><p>1. It&#x27;s a web browser</p><p>---------------------</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s new browser is another swipe at Google, which has struggled to keep pace since ChatGPT&#x27;s debut.</p><p>Atlas is essentially an insertion of the world&#x27;s most popular chatbot into a browser experience.
* The move positions the company against other AI-fueled rivals with browsers like Perplexity&#x27;s Comet, Apple&#x27;s Safari and Microsoft&#x27;s Edge.</p><p>The intrigue: Both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge already integrate their chatbots with the browser.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether browsing with a chatbot is a killer use case.
* If it becomes one, ChatGPT&#x27;s popularity could lure Chrome and Edge devotees to Atlas.</p><p>2. It&#x27;s a social media network</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s Sora not only upended reality on the web, it also became the first real competitor to Meta&#x27;s social media dominance since TikTok.</p><p>The invite-only app rocketed to — and stayed at — the top of Apple&#x27;s download charts.
* OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised to include features that would keep users from infinitely scrolling until their brain rotted, but the app&#x27;s already got early adopters hooked.</p><p>3. It&#x27;s a platform</p><p>------------------</p><p>At OpenAI&#x27;s developer dayin early October, the company gave developers a way to offer their apps directly within ChatGPT, so users could summon Spotify, Zillow, Figma, Canva and others directly from the chatbot.</p><p>Developers can already submit their own apps, with monetization coming soon, putting OpenAI in direct competition with Apple&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s app stores.</p><p>4. It&#x27;s a shopping experience</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p>OpenAI has also partnered with the world&#x27;s biggest retailer (Walmart) to compete with the world&#x27;s biggest online retailer (Amazon).</p><p>ChatGPT users can buy products straight from Walmart through its new Instant Checkout program.
* The company also made deals with Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants for shopping through chat.</p><p>5. It&#x27;s (trying to be) the next Apple</p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>Reports of OpenAI&#x27;s hardware partnershipwith former Apple designer Jony Ive have been percolating for over a year.</p><p>The company paid $5 billion in stock for Ive&#x27;s startup in May, including the acquisition of Ive and three other veteran Apple designers.
* OpenAI&#x27;s poaching continued with recruits from Apple&#x27;s design, manufacturing and supply chain teams. In September, OpenAI began talks with Apple&#x27;s third-party suppliers themselves.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>1 big thing: OpenAI everywhere</p><p>Megan Morrone</p><p>OpenAI isn&#x27;t satisfied with being the top chatbot. It&#x27;s making a play for total tech supremacy, one platform at a time.</p><p>Tuesday&#x27;s launch of OpenAI&#x27;s new browser — Atlas — is a fast follow to the company&#x27;s Sora social media app, app store-like developer tools, commerce plays, plus rumors of future hardware devices with still-unknown form factors.</p><p>The big picture: OpenAI doesn&#x27;t just want ChatGPT to be the everything app. It wants to be the everything company and knock all of its competitors aside.</p><p>1. It&#x27;s a web browser</p><p>---------------------</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s new browser is another swipe at Google, which has struggled to keep pace since ChatGPT&#x27;s debut.</p><p>Atlas is essentially an insertion of the world&#x27;s most popular chatbot into a browser experience.
* The move positions the company against other AI-fueled rivals with browsers like Perplexity&#x27;s Comet, Apple&#x27;s Safari and Microsoft&#x27;s Edge.</p><p>The intrigue: Both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge already integrate their chatbots with the browser.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether browsing with a chatbot is a killer use case.
* If it becomes one, ChatGPT&#x27;s popularity could lure Chrome and Edge devotees to Atlas.</p><p>2. It&#x27;s a social media network</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s Sora not only upended reality on the web, it also became the first real competitor to Meta&#x27;s social media dominance since TikTok.</p><p>The invite-only app rocketed to — and stayed at — the top of Apple&#x27;s download charts.
* OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised to include features that would keep users from infinitely scrolling until their brain rotted, but the app&#x27;s already got early adopters hooked.</p><p>3.

* The company also made deals with Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants for shopping through chat.</p><p>5. It&#x27;s (trying to be) the next Apple</p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>Reports of OpenAI&#x27;s hardware partnershipwith former Apple designer Jony Ive have been percolating for over a year.</p><p>The company paid $5 billion in stock for Ive&#x27;s startup in May, including the acquisition of Ive and three other veteran Apple designers.
* OpenAI&#x27;s poaching continued with recruits from Apple&#x27;s design, manufacturing and supply chain teams. In September, OpenAI began talks with Apple&#x27;s third-party suppliers themselves.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today&#x27;s AI+ is 1,148 words, a 4.5-minute read.</p><p>1 big thing: OpenAI launches new web browser</p><p>A screenshot from the ChatGPT Atlas setup process. Source: OpenAI</p><p>OpenAI&#x27;s new Atlas browser — released yesterday — offers powerful new capabilities, though blending web and chatbot data brings new privacy and security risks.</p><p>Why it matters: People are already sharing some of their most sensitive thoughts and information with ChatGPT.</p><p>Letting an AI browse for you expands that dramatically.</p><p>Catch up quick: Atlas, a free app combining ChatGPT and a web browser, launched first on Mac, with mobile and Windows versions coming soon.</p><p>In addition to standard browser features, Atlas offers a sidebar that lets people have a dialog with ChatGPT about the page they are browsing. * There&#x27;s also an agent mode (currently only for paid subscribers) that allows Atlas to handle certain tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. * Atlas is based on the open source Chromium engine that powers Google&#x27;s Chrome, among other browsers. * Atlas includes parental controls similar to ChatGPT&#x27;s, allowing parents to disable certain features.</p><p>What they&#x27;re saying: OpenAI is trying to make sure people understand there are greater risks to using Atlas, especially when using agent mode.</p><p>An Atlas prompt for agent mode warns: &quot;ChatGPT is built to protect you, but there is always some risk that attackers could successfully break our safeguards to access your data, or take actions as you on logged in sites.&quot;</p><p>OpenAI lets users decide, site by site, whether Atlas can log in or just browse publicly.</p><p>Users can watch the agent in action and stop or take over tasks at any time. * OpenAI also notes that the Atlas agent is limited to browsing and can&#x27;t execute code or access local files.</p><p>Between the lines: Users have a number of other choices that can add to or decrease the amount of data they are sharing.</p><p>In addition to being able to save cookies and passwords, Atlas has an optional &quot;memories&quot; feature that offers deeper personalization but means more of one&#x27;s browsing data is being stored. (People can delete specific memories after the fact, similar to the feature in ChatGPT.) * There is an incognito mode, where any browsing being done isn&#x27;t linked to your ChatGPT account and isn&#x27;t saved in your browser history. * Other settings dictate how much data OpenAI has access to. OpenAI says it won&#x27;t use Atlas browsing data to train its models unless consumers choose to share it.</p><p>Yes, but: No matter which settings one chooses, Atlas is still putting more highly personal data in one place.</p><p>Even if that isn&#x27;t a huge concern today, it could lead to highly targeted advertising, should the company decide to head down that path. * That&#x27;s also more data that could be available to governments or law enforcement should they get a court&#x27;s permission or other access.</p><p>2. Exclusive: Meta overhauls legacy AI operations</p><p>Meta is cutting several hundred roles from its AI unit even as it continues to hire for its newer TBD Lab, Axios has learned.</p><p>Why it matters: The company concluded that its long-standing AI efforts became overly bureaucratic and hopes the reorganization will create a more agile operation, according to an internal memo seen by Axios.</p><p>&quot;By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,&quot; Meta chief AI officer Alexandr Wang wrote in the memo.</p><p>Driving the news: Meta is cutting roughly 600 positions out of the several thousand roles within Meta&#x27;s superintelligence lab.</p><p>The cuts will affect the company&#x27;s FAIR AI research, product-related AI and AI infrastructure units, while sparing the newly formed TBD Lab unit. * The company is encouraging affected employees to apply for other jobs within Meta and expects most will find another position internally. * &quot;This is a talented group of individuals, and we need their skills in other parts of the company,&quot; Wang said.</p><p>The other side: The company is still actively recruiting and hiring for its TBD Lab unit.</p><p>Most recently, the company hired OpenAI research scientist Ananya Kumar, according to a source. * Before that, Meta nabbed Andrew Tulloch, a co-founder of Mira Murati&#x27;s Thinking Machines.</p><p>Between the lines: CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew concerned several months ago that the company&#x27;s existing AI efforts weren&#x27;t leading to needed breakthroughs or improved performance.</p><p>That conclusion led to this reorganization, the launch of TBD Labs, and the pricey hiring binge that coincided with Meta&#x27;s $15 billion investment in Scale AI and the hiring of Wang. * &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about the models we&#x27;re training, our compute plans and the products we&#x27;re building, and I&#x27;m confident in our path to build towards superintelligence,&quot; Wang said in the memo.</p><p>3. AI leaders push to pause superintelligence</p><p>Ashley Gold</p><p>A growing number of people — including AI pioneers and other prominent tech figures — want to stop the development of AI that can outperform all humans.</p><p>A group of scientists, policymakers and actors is calling for a pause on superintelligence until it&#x27;s proven safe and controllable.</p><p>Why it matters: AI development is moving at breakneck speed with minimal oversight and with the full-throated endorsement of the Trump administration.</p><p>AI &quot;doomers&quot; have lost their foothold with U.S. policymakers. But they&#x27;re still trying to be heard and are highly involved in global AI policy debates.</p><p>Driving the news: The call to action, organized by the Future of Life Institute, has more than 800 signatures from a diverse group, including:</p><p>AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Sir Richard Branson, Steve Bannon, Susan Rice, will.i.am and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. * The group also released polling that found that three-quarters of U.S. adults want strong regulations on AI development, with 64% of those polled saying they want an &quot;immediate pause&quot; on advanced AI development, per a survey of 2,000 adults from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5.</p><p>Yes, but: In early 2023, the Future of Life Institute and many of the same signatories published a similar letter calling for a six-month pause on training any models more powerful than GPT-4.</p><p>That pause was largely ignored.</p><p>What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in,&quot; a statement from the group&#x27;s website reads.</p>]]></description>

Efforts to maintain that dominance are ushering in new, uncomfortable norms.</p><p>Zoom in: &quot;The Geopolitics of AI: Decoding the New Global Operating System&quot; calls the 2024 presidential election &quot;the most consequential event&quot; that has shifted the geopolitics of AI over the past year.</p><p>This year, the U.S. &quot;government&#x27;s orientation to the tech sector and to the wider international community has shifted,&quot; the JPMorgan Chase Center for Geopolitics wrote.</p><p>Private-sector AI or AI-adjacent companies now see the government as a dealmaker or a direct investor.</p><p>The Trump administration took a stake in Intel, and officials agreed to let Nvidia sell some chips in China in exchange for a portion of sales — developments that some have likened to a command economy.
* The U.S. is &quot;reshuffling the global conditions in which nations are approaching their AI priorities,&quot; the report says.</p><p>What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to trade places with any other country in the world when it comes to where we are on AI,&quot; Derek Chollet, an author of the report who leads JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s Center for Geopolitics, tells Axios.</p><p>Chollet was counselor to Secretary of State Tony Blinken in the Biden administration and then chief of staff to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.
* The report says the U.S. dominates in terms of private-sector AI investment, with the first half of 2025 on track to surpass the previous year&#x27;s sum.</p><p>Yes, but: Some Trump-era policies might ultimately set America back in AI innovation, the report says.</p><p>&quot;Recent trends related to tariffs, immigration and the reduction in U.S. science and technology funding may be in tension with the nation&#x27;s stated AI goals globally,&quot; the authors write.</p><p>Driving the news: That tension is on display in the latest dial-up of trade tensions between the U.S. and China — the two nations that JPMorgan Chase says are most AI dominant, though the nations are on divergent paths.</p><p>China threatened to cut off global access to its rare earth supplies, a critical input for a range of U.S. products, including semiconductors.
* Trump threatened to retaliate with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and harsher export controls on critical software, though later insisted &quot;it will all be fine!&quot; with China.</p><p>What to watch: &quot;AI is as geopolitically significant as anything since the dawn of the nuclear age 80 years ago,&quot; Chollet tells Axios.</p><p>&quot;Governments drove technological development in the nuclear age, but AI has principally been driven by the private sector. Now governments all around the world are having to play catch-up,&quot; says Chollet.</p><p>The bottom line: JPMorgan Chase says there are seven &quot;strategic axes&quot; that are &quot;already motivating governments, businesses, and alliances to reposition in ways that will shape the century ahead.&quot;</p><p>1. &quot;Assertive China&quot; is investing huge sums to try to position itself at the &quot;forefront of AI development.&quot;</p><p>2. America is repositioning itself&quot;to counterbalance China&#x27;s rise.&quot;</p><p>3. The European Union is &quot;striving to reduce their dependence on foreign technology and bolster their own AI capabilities.&quot;</p><p>4. The Middle East&#x27;s&quot;sovereign wealth funds are leveraging energy abundance to become key players in AI infrastructure.&quot;</p><p>5. Labor disruption &amp; populism: AI &quot;impacts are likely to include significant transitions for markets, for work, and for workers.&quot;</p><p>6. Defense leadership: &quot;Militaries that integrate AI fastest will hold decisive battlefield advantages.&quot;
7. Energy &amp; hardware as the new chokepoints: &quot;Semiconductors, critical minerals, and electricity capacity define who can scale AI, and who risks falling behind.&quot;</p><p>2. AI writing hasn&#x27;t won the web yet</p><p>Megan Morrone</p><p>New articles generated by AIbriefly outnumbered those written by humans online, but the two are now roughly equal, per a new report from SEO firm Graphite.</p><p>Why it matters: Researchers have long feared that if AI-made content online overwhelms human-created material, large language models could chokeon their own exhaust and collapse.</p><p>The big picture: A 2022 report from Europol estimated that 90% of online content would be generated by AI by 2026.</p><p>According to Graphite&#x27;s analysis of 65,000 URLs that were posted online between 2020 and 2025,the percentage of AI-generated articles rose sharply after ChatGPT&#x27;s launch in November 2022.
* The percentage of AI-generated articles in this data set briefly surpassed human-written articles in November 2024, but the two have stayed roughly equal since.</p><p>What they did: Graphite used an AI detector called Surfer to analyze a random sample of URLs from Common Crawl, an open source database of over 300 billion web pages. The database spans 18 years and adds 3–5 billion new pages monthly.</p><p>The pages had publish dates between January 2020 and May 2025 and were classified as either articles or listicles using Graphite&#x27;s article page type classifier.
* Articles were deemed AI-generated if 50% or less of the content was found by Surfer to have been written by a human.</p><p>Zoom in: Distinguishing between machine and human-written content is tricky.</p><p>To evaluate Surfer&#x27;s accuracy, Graphite tested it with its own sample of AI-generated articles and with a set published before ChatGPT&#x27;s launch, which were likely written by humans.
* Surfer had a 4.2% false positive rate (labeling human-written articles as AI-generated) and a 0.6% false negative rate (labeling AI-written articles as human) for articles it generated with GPT-4o.</p><p>By the numbers: Content farms may also be learning that AI-generated content isn&#x27;t prioritized by search engines and chatbot responses, according to a second report from Graphite.</p><p>Graphite found that 86% of articles ranking in Google Search were written by humans, and 14% were generated by AI.
* The pattern held across chatbots, too. 82% of articles cited by ChatGPT and Perplexity were written by humans, and only 18% were AI-generated, according to Graphite&#x27;s research.
* When AI-generated articles do appear in Google Search, they tend to rank lower than human-written articles.</p><p>Yes, but: Researchers told Axios that a definitive count of AI-made content isn&#x27;t possible with today&#x27;s tools and definitions.</p><p>It&#x27;s hard to determine what content is AI-generated and what is human-generated because humans are increasingly working together with AI.
* &quot;At this point, it&#x27;s a symbiosis more than a dichotomy,&quot; Stefano Soatto, professor of computer science at UCLA and VP at Amazon Web Services, told Axios.</p>]]></description>
