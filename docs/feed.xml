      <description><![CDATA[<p>bad news is I did something to my back and it&#x27;s aching. The good news is I learned a fun new word for a pinched nerve: radiculopathy. Also, RIP Miss Major. Today&#x27;s AI+ is 1,283 words, a 5-minute read.</p><p>Situational awareness: OpenAI and Walmart are teaming up to let shoppers plan meals, restock essentials and use instant checkout directly through ChatGPT, Axios&#x27; Kelly Tyko reports.</p><p>1 big thing: Global AI race will redefine geopolitics</p><p>Courtenay Brown</p><p>A new report from JPMorgan Chasewarns that AI will shake up global alliances, stoke fresh populism and change the rules of war in the century ahead.</p><p>Why it matters: The report, first seen by Axios, says the U.S. is dominating the worldwide AI race. Efforts to maintain that dominance are ushering in new, uncomfortable norms.</p><p>Zoom in: &quot;The Geopolitics of AI: Decoding the New Global Operating System&quot; calls the 2024 presidential election &quot;the most consequential event&quot; that has shifted the geopolitics of AI over the past year.</p><p>This year, the U.S. &quot;government&#x27;s orientation to the tech sector and to the wider international community has shifted,&quot; the JPMorgan Chase Center for Geopolitics wrote.</p><p>Private-sector AI or AI-adjacent companies now see the government as a dealmaker or a direct investor.</p><p>The Trump administration took a stake in Intel, and officials agreed to let Nvidia sell some chips in China in exchange for a portion of sales — developments that some have likened to a command economy.
* The U.S. is &quot;reshuffling the global conditions in which nations are approaching their AI priorities,&quot; the report says.</p><p>What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to trade places with any other country in the world when it comes to where we are on AI,&quot; Derek Chollet, an author of the report who leads JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s Center for Geopolitics, tells Axios.</p><p>Chollet was counselor to Secretary of State Tony Blinken in the Biden administration and then chief of staff to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.
* The report says the U.S. dominates in terms of private-sector AI investment, with the first half of 2025 on track to surpass the previous year&#x27;s sum.</p><p>Yes, but: Some Trump-era policies might ultimately set America back in AI innovation, the report says.</p><p>&quot;Recent trends related to tariffs, immigration and the reduction in U.S. science and technology funding may be in tension with the nation&#x27;s stated AI goals globally,&quot; the authors write.</p><p>Driving the news: That tension is on display in the latest dial-up of trade tensions between the U.S. and China — the two nations that JPMorgan Chase says are most AI dominant, though the nations are on divergent paths.</p><p>China threatened to cut off global access to its rare earth supplies, a critical input for a range of U.S. products, including semiconductors.
* Trump threatened to retaliate with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and harsher export controls on critical software, though later insisted &quot;it will all be fine!&quot; with China.</p><p>What to watch: &quot;AI is as geopolitically significant as anything since the dawn of the nuclear age 80 years ago,&quot; Chollet tells Axios.</p><p>&quot;Governments drove technological development in the nuclear age, but AI has principally been driven by the private sector. Now governments all around the world are having to play catch-up,&quot; says Chollet.</p><p>The bottom line: JPMorgan Chase says there are seven &quot;strategic axes&quot; that are &quot;already motivating governments, businesses, and alliances to reposition in ways that will shape the century ahead.&quot;</p><p>1. &quot;Assertive China&quot; is investing huge sums to try to position itself at the &quot;forefront of AI development.&quot;</p><p>2. America is repositioning itself&quot;to counterbalance China&#x27;s rise.&quot;</p><p>3. The European Union is &quot;striving to reduce their dependence on foreign technology and bolster their own AI capabilities.&quot;</p><p>4. The Middle East&#x27;s&quot;sovereign wealth funds are leveraging energy abundance to become key players in AI infrastructure.&quot;</p><p>5. Labor disruption &amp; populism: AI &quot;impacts are likely to include significant transitions for markets, for work, and for workers.&quot;</p><p>6. Defense leadership: &quot;Militaries that integrate AI fastest will hold decisive battlefield advantages.&quot;
7. Energy &amp; hardware as the new chokepoints: &quot;Semiconductors, critical minerals, and electricity capacity define who can scale AI, and who risks falling behind.&quot;</p><p>2. AI writing hasn&#x27;t won the web yet</p><p>Megan Morrone</p><p>New articles generated by AIbriefly outnumbered those written by humans online, but the two are now roughly equal, per a new report from SEO firm Graphite.</p><p>Why it matters: Researchers have long feared that if AI-made content online overwhelms human-created material, large language models could chokeon their own exhaust and collapse.</p><p>The big picture: A 2022 report from Europol estimated that 90% of online content would be generated by AI by 2026.</p><p>According to Graphite&#x27;s analysis of 65,000 URLs that were posted online between 2020 and 2025,the percentage of AI-generated articles rose sharply after ChatGPT&#x27;s launch in November 2022.
* The percentage of AI-generated articles in this data set briefly surpassed human-written articles in November 2024, but the two have stayed roughly equal since.</p><p>What they did: Graphite used an AI detector called Surfer to analyze a random sample of URLs from Common Crawl, an open source database of over 300 billion web pages. The database spans 18 years and adds 3–5 billion new pages monthly.</p><p>The pages had publish dates between January 2020 and May 2025 and were classified as either articles or listicles using Graphite&#x27;s article page type classifier.
* Articles were deemed AI-generated if 50% or less of the content was found by Surfer to have been written by a human.</p><p>Zoom in: Distinguishing between machine and human-written content is tricky.</p><p>To evaluate Surfer&#x27;s accuracy, Graphite tested it with its own sample of AI-generated articles and with a set published before ChatGPT&#x27;s launch, which were likely written by humans.
* Surfer had a 4.2% false positive rate (labeling human-written articles as AI-generated) and a 0.6% false negative rate (labeling AI-written articles as human) for articles it generated with GPT-4o.</p><p>By the numbers: Content farms may also be learning that AI-generated content isn&#x27;t prioritized by search engines and chatbot responses, according to a second report from Graphite.</p><p>Graphite found that 86% of articles ranking in Google Search were written by humans, and 14% were generated by AI.
* The pattern held across chatbots, too. 82% of articles cited by ChatGPT and Perplexity were written by humans, and only 18% were AI-generated, according to Graphite&#x27;s research.
* When AI-generated articles do appear in Google Search, they tend to rank lower than human-written articles.</p><p>Yes, but: Researchers told Axios that a definitive count of AI-made content isn&#x27;t possible with today&#x27;s tools and definitions.</p><p>It&#x27;s hard to determine what content is AI-generated and what is human-generated because humans are increasingly working together with AI.
* &quot;At this point, it&#x27;s a symbiosis more than a dichotomy,&quot; Stefano Soatto, professor of computer science at UCLA and VP at Amazon Web Services, told Axios.</p>]]></description>
