Axios AI Plus is gearing up for its summit in San Francisco on December 4th. The lineup includes big names like Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Box's Aaron Levie, Sierra's Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor, and Geometric AI's Gary Marcus. 

The AI boom is showing no signs of slowing down. Spending is only ramping up, with major players like Meta, Microsoft, and Google making significant investments. Meta plans to spend at least $70 billion on AI infrastructure this year, with even more next year. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has increased its spending forecast to at least $91 billion. Microsoft is also upping its investment in AI, driven by strong demand.

However, there's a note of caution. Some discussions suggest that companies might be spending beyond their means, creating a financial loop that could be risky if one part fails.

The AI boom has become a significant economic force. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dismissed concerns that lower interest rates might create an AI bubble. He emphasized that investments in data centers are based on long-term productivity gains, not just interest rates.

This massive spending is having a real impact. Vanguard's Joe Davis noted it's been crucial for economic growth. Companies like Caterpillar are seeing benefits too. Their power generation segment sales jumped 33%, mainly due to demand for engines used in data centers. AI's influence is spreading across industries, driving demand throughout the supply chain.

The intrigue here is that while the boom is boosting profits and driving stock market highs, it's not yet translating into job growth. Powell pointed out that the labor market is still softening. Data centers create construction jobs initially but don't need much staffing once they're up and running. Companies like Nvidia say they need more talent and plan to keep expanding, but it's uncertain if that'll counteract the signs of rising layoffs.

What to watch: There's growing local opposition to building data centers across the country. Communities are concerned about their size, cost, and the impact on utility prices due to high power consumption. This hasn't stopped spending yet, but it might lead to reevaluating where and how money is spent.

The bottom line: The race to shape the future of AI is far from over, and recent earnings show there's no finish line in sight. The AI industry is gearing up for a multimillion-dollar ad campaign through a new policy advocacy group, as Axios has learned.

Why it matters: This new group, Build American AI, signals that the cash-rich AI industry is ready to spend big to push its agenda, focusing on federal rather than state regulation.

Zoom out: Build American AI is linked to Leading the Future, a pro-AI super PAC. While Leading the Future plans to invest tens of millions in the 2026 midterms, Build American AI will focus on issue-based ads promoting its legislative agenda. Unlike the super PAC, Build American AI is a nonprofit, meaning it doesn't have to disclose its donors. Leading the Future has already raised $100 million, positioning it as a key player in the midterms.

Zoom in: Organizers say Build American AI will push for federal regulation of AI. The industry wants consistent policies across states, aligning with President Trump's stance. The group seems ready to challenge political figures who support state-level AI regulation. AI leaders worry that state policies could lead to overregulation and prefer uniform federal guidelines. Some states, like California, have already enacted or are considering AI regulations. Build American AI plans to spend eight figures on advertising by spring, though it's unclear which states will be targeted.

What they're saying: "We will aggressively highlight the opportunities AI creates for workers and communities, and we will expose and challenge the misinformation being spread by ideological groups trying to undermine the nation's ability to lead," said Leading the Future co-heads Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto to Axios.
