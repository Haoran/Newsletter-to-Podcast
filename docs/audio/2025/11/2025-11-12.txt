First up, AI is stepping into the realm of spirituality, offering churches a new way to stay relevant. With shrinking staff and empty pews, some congregations are turning to technology to engage their growing online audiences. But this raises questions about the true nature of spiritual guidance.

Next, new AI-powered apps let users text with Jesus or talk to the Bible, creating an experience that feels like communicating with a deity. Other apps offer personalized prayers, confession options, and religious advice for life's decisions. However, not everyone is convinced this is a good idea. Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, skeptically asks, "What could go wrong?"

Meanwhile, megachurches are consolidating their congregations, but even the most charismatic pastors find it challenging to provide personal counseling to such large groups. The TryTank Research Institute for the Episcopal Church is using AI to respond to spiritual queries, drawing on church resources to help.

Additionally, some AI applications analyze congregational data to improve outreach and communication. Pastors are also using AI to assist with sermon writing and reduce their preparation time.

Finally, Hope's consulting firm is guiding churches and minority-owned businesses in using AI ethically. The potential for AI in scheduling, coordinating preaching engagements, and missions work is vast, and many believe we've only scratched the surface of how technology can advance spiritual missions.
