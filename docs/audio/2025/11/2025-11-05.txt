First up, Google researchers have uncovered the first known instance of AI-powered malware being used in a real-world cyberattack. This discovery highlights a new frontier in cybersecurity threats, as hackers begin to leverage generative AI to enhance their attacks. Google's Threat Intelligence Group identified two new malware strains, PromptFlux and PromptSteal, which can adapt their behavior mid-attack using large language models. PromptFlux is still in development, showing signs of frequent updates to evade detection. Meanwhile, PromptSteal has been used by Russian military hackers in attacks on Ukrainian entities. Though these strains are still early in their development, they represent a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape. Google's team is particularly concerned about PromptSteal's reliance on open-source models, which could make sophisticated attacks accessible to less skilled hackers. However, most cybercriminals continue to rely on traditional methods like phishing and stolen credentials. As Billy Leonard from Google's Threat Intelligence Group puts it, while these developments are concerning, they are not cause for panic.

Next, Google is integrating its Gemini chatbot into Maps, allowing users to interact with their navigation app through conversation. This move comes as tech giants continue to push the idea of chatbots becoming ubiquitous in our digital lives. With the new AI features, users can enjoy hands-free navigation on Android, iOS, Android Auto, and eventually Apple's CarPlay. This conversational system aims to make navigation more intuitive by helping users with tasks like identifying unmarked turns, reporting accidents, and checking parking availability.

First up, Google is enhancing Google Maps with AI to make navigation less confusing. Instead of vague directions like "turn left in 500 yards," the AI, called Gemini, will guide you using clear landmarks from Google Street View. While this aims to improve hands-free navigation, Google reassures us that Gemini doesn't decide your route, addressing concerns about past navigation mishaps.

Next, Amazon is in a spat with Perplexity over its AI browser making automatic purchases. Amazon calls for a halt, but Perplexity sees this as bullying. It's a developing story in the realm of AI and consumer rights.

Meanwhile, a new bipartisan bill could change how companies report AI-related workforce changes. If passed, large companies and federal agencies would need to inform the Labor Department about AI-driven layoffs, hires, and retraining efforts.

In other legal news, Stability AI has mostly won a court case in the UK against Getty Images. The case involved allegations of copyright and trademark infringement, marking a significant moment for AI and intellectual property.

Finally, OpenAI has launched an Android version of its Sora video app, expanding its reach to more users.

And for a bit of inspiration, there's a TED talk about butterflies that might just brighten your day. It’s a reminder of the beauty in the world amidst all the tech talk.
