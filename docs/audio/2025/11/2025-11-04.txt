First up, as layoffs continue, training AI is becoming a popular side gig. Companies need human help to select, clean, and label data, teaching AI models to answer questions and understand images. Uber is letting drivers earn extra by doing simple AI tasks when they're not on the road. This could help develop self-driving tech. Meanwhile, Amazon's new augmented reality glasses aim to make delivery jobs safer, though they might also gather data for future autonomous systems. In San Francisco, startup Mercor pays professionals like doctors and lawyers to train AI, aiming to replace tasks done by junior and eventually senior employees. OpenAI is working with Juilliard students and former bankers to teach AI music composition and entry-level finance tasks. Many workers are choosing to join the AI wave, hoping to stay relevant as automation grows. According to NYU Stern's Vasant Dhar, technology pushes us to improve, but not everyone keeps up. The takeaway? Humans are driving AI's growth, possibly at the cost of their future jobs.

Next, let's talk about Walmart's big bet on AI. Despite rising layoffs, rehiring is also on the rise, a trend dubbed the "layoff boomerang." According to workplace platform Visier, AI might not be the job eliminator it's often portrayed as. Andrea Derler from Visier suggests that AI is sometimes used as a convenient excuse for layoffs, but its role in job replacement isn't fully proven yet.

First up, rehiring rates are on the rise, even as AI-powered agents and digital workers become more common. Visier's analysis of data from 2.4 million employees across 142 companies shows that 5.3% of laid-off workers are being rehired by their former employers. This rate has been stable since 2018 but has recently increased. The reasons behind this uptick aren't clear, but it suggests a bigger planning issue for executives. 

Next, let's talk about AI investments. A recent MIT study found that 95% of organizations aren't seeing returns on their AI pilot projects. Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers suggests that companies might not be spending their AI budgets wisely. Layoffs, while intended to save money, can be costly. Orgvue data shows that for every dollar saved, companies spend $1.27 on hidden costs like unemployment insurance and severance packages. 

Finally, a Midwest nonprofit is stepping up to support local industries. They're launching an AI caucus to enhance manufacturing and agriculture in the region, especially as data centers continue to pop up.
