First up, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are shifting their philanthropic focus to biology and AI, aiming to accelerate disease cures. They've long supported education and housing, but now they're betting on AI to speed up scientific breakthroughs.

Next, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is bringing all its scientific efforts under the new name Biohub. They're also integrating EvolutionaryScale, an AI research lab, into their operations. Alex Rives, co-founder of EvolutionaryScale, will lead the science efforts, and the lab's team will join Biohub.

Meanwhile, Chan and Zuckerberg recently hosted a gathering of about 50 AI researchers and tech leaders to discuss this new direction. Notable attendees included former Meta executives and other prominent figures in tech and science.

What they're saying is that the Biohub model has been their most impactful project, and they want to expand it. Chan emphasized their goal to empower scientists to take risks and explore bold questions in biology without focusing on a specific disease.

Finally, this shift hasn't been without controversy. Some communities have benefited from their earlier projects, like a school in East Palo Alto offering free tuition and health care, which is set to close in 2026. Despite this, Zuckerberg and Chan remain committed to their ambitious goal of curing all diseases, believing it's worth pursuing.
