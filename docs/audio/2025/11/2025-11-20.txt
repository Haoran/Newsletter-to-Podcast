First up, the Middle East is rapidly becoming a key player in the AI world, not just as an investor but as a hub for data centers. A series of new Saudi deals, announced yesterday, highlight this trend.

Next, these deals are part of a strategic move to align Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries with U.S. technology, steering them away from Chinese AI systems.

Meanwhile, at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, tech companies unveiled new projects with Humain, a Saudi AI and infrastructure developer. This comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington, D.C.

The region's vast energy resources are a major attraction for U.S. companies eager to expand their AI infrastructure quickly.

With billions being invested in AI infrastructure, the Middle East is becoming a crucial bridge and a geopolitical test for U.S. tech firms.

Elon Musk's company has inked a deal to build affordable GPU data centers in Saudi Arabia with Humain, and plans to deploy Grok models across the country.

Humain is collaborating with AMD and Cisco to deliver up to 1 gigawatt of AI infrastructure by 2030.

Finally, Humain will roll out up to 600,000 Nvidia GPUs across Saudi Arabia and the U.S. over the next three years, focusing on physical and Arabic language AI. Plus, Humain and AWS are set to deploy 150,000 AI accelerators for an AI Zone in Riyadh.
