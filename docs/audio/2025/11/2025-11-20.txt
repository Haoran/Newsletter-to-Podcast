First up, the Middle East is quickly becoming a major player in AI investment and data centers. Saudi Arabia is leading the charge with new deals that were announced recently. 

Next, these agreements are part of a strategy to integrate U.S. technology into the region, countering the influence of Chinese AI systems. 

Meanwhile, at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum and during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to D.C., tech companies revealed a slew of new projects. These involve Humain, a Saudi AI and infrastructure developer supported by the Public Investment Fund.

The Middle East's vast energy resources are attracting U.S. companies eager to expand their AI infrastructure quickly. 

With billions being invested, the region is becoming a vital link and a geopolitical challenge for American tech firms.

Elon Musk's company has entered into a framework agreement with Humain to create affordable GPU data centers in Saudi Arabia and to roll out Grok models nationwide.

Additionally, Humain is collaborating with AMD and Cisco to establish up to 1 gigawatt of AI infrastructure by 2030.

Finally, Humain plans to deploy up to 600,000 Nvidia GPUs across Saudi Arabia and the U.S. over the next three years. This includes projects focused on physical AI and Arabic language AI.

In partnership with AWS, Humain will also set up 150,000 AI accelerators for a new AI Zone in Riyadh.
