The AI spending spree is making waves. It's crucial because as this boom continues, it helps balance out other big changes, like shifts in global trade and the evolving job market.

Meta has upped its spending forecast, planning to pour at least $70 billion into AI infrastructure this year, with even more next year. Alphabet, Google's parent company, isn't far behind. After hitting a record $100 billion in revenue last quarter, they're aiming to spend at least $91 billion this year.

Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, points to strong demand as the reason for their ongoing investment in AI, both in terms of capital and talent.

However, some earnings calls hint that this demand might be driven by companies overspending or financing each other in a risky cycle that could collapse if one part fails.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dismissed concerns that lower interest rates from the Fed would create an AI bubble. He explained that spending on data centers isn't particularly sensitive to interest rates. Instead, it's based on long-term expectations of significant investment and productivity gains.

The impact of these massive investments is undeniable. Vanguard's global chief economist, Joe Davis, noted that this spending has been a crucial support for the economy, preventing much weaker growth numbers.

Caterpillar's CEO, Joe Creed, shared that their power generation segment saw a 33% increase in equipment sales, mainly driven by demand for engines used in data centers.
