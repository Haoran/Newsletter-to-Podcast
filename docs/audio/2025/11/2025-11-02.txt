The AI spending spree is making waves. It's crucial because this boom could help balance out other big shifts, like changes in global trade and the labor market.

Meta has upped its spending forecast, planning to invest at least $70 billion this year on AI infrastructure, with even more expected next year. Alphabet, Google's parent company, just reported a record $100 billion in revenue last quarter and has also increased its spending forecast to at least $91 billion for the year.

Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, attributes their increased investments in AI to strong demand, focusing on both capital and talent.

However, some earnings calls this week hint that the demand might be driven by companies overspending or financing each other in a risky cycle that could collapse if one part fails.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dismissed concerns that lower interest rates could create an AI bubble. He believes the investment in data centers is driven by long-term productivity goals, not just interest rates.

The massive spending is undeniably impactful. Vanguard's global chief economist, Joe Davis, noted that this investment has been a crucial support for the economy, preventing weaker growth.

Caterpillar CEO Joe Creed highlighted a 33% surge in sales of power generation equipment, mainly due to the demand for engines used in data centers.
