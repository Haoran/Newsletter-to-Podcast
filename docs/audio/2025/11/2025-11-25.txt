First up, the AI landscape is buzzing with competition as OpenAI's ChatGPT faces a formidable challenger: Google's Gemini. Google's latest model, Gemini 3 Pro, has been making waves with its impressive performance, catching OpenAI off guard. This shift is significant because Google, once trailing behind, is now setting the pace in the AI race. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has warned his team to prepare for some challenging times as they work to regain their footing.

Next, Google's Gemini 3 Pro is not just a new model; it's a game-changer. Released on November 18, it powers Google's core search engine and the Gemini app. Industry experts praise its superior benchmarks and seamless integration into Google's ecosystem. Notably, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff expressed his amazement at Gemini's capabilities, highlighting its speed and versatility. However, some caution that while Gemini has access to vast data, it occasionally struggles with accuracy, especially on less familiar topics.

Meanwhile, it's essential to remember that the roots of generative AI trace back to Google’s 2017 Transformer paper. Google has the advantage of vast resources and infrastructure, allowing it to rapidly deploy new AI features. Despite this, OpenAI still holds a strong position with its loyal user base of around 800 million weekly active users. They've been enhancing ChatGPT with memory features for more personalized interactions, though transitioning user data to Gemini remains a complex task.

Finally, while Google's advancements are impressive, the speed of their progress has surprised many. Yet, OpenAI's brand loyalty and innovative features keep it competitive in this fast-evolving AI landscape.

First up, Gemini 3 is making waves in the tech world. It's now leading many benchmark tests and could pull even further ahead with Google's upcoming Gemini 3 Deep Think feature. This enhanced reasoning mode promises to boost its performance even more.

Next, OpenAI is rolling out a new ChatGPT shopping research tool just in time for the holiday season. This feature dives into product pages, reviews, and prices to offer personalized shopping advice. It's available now for all ChatGPT users on various plans, with nearly unlimited usage through the holidays. While it aims to provide deeper insights, simple queries will still get standard responses. OpenAI assures users that chats aren't shared with retailers, and results are sourced from high-quality sites. However, be aware that some details might still be inaccurate.

Meanwhile, President Trump signed an executive order to bolster AI research and development, aiming to lower energy costs for Americans. The administration wants to support private-sector innovation while addressing concerns about energy bills and job displacement. The Genesis Mission, part of this order, will enhance information sharing between the government, industry, and academia, with the Department of Energy developing an AI platform for scientific use.

Finally, Target and Walmart are partnering with ChatGPT to transform the AI chatbot into a shopping platform. This move is part of OpenAI's plan to eventually enable direct purchasing through ChatGPT for merchants in its Instant Checkout program.

First up, the administration is launching the Genesis Mission, a major initiative likened to the Apollo space program. They're using AI to revolutionize scientific research, from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics. Michael Kratsios from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy highlights that AI will automate experiments and speed up simulations. Energy Secretary Chris Wright adds that this could reduce costs and improve American lives, including job creation.

Next, in the energy sector, the focus is on increasing energy supply, enhancing grid efficiency, and tackling rising electricity costs. The White House believes the Genesis Mission will lead to significant scientific breakthroughs, reducing discovery times from years to mere days or hours, allowing scientists to test new ideas rapidly.

Finally, Anthropic's Opus 4.5 model is now compatible with Google Chrome and Microsoft Excel, showcasing AI's expanding capabilities. Meanwhile, Google's Nano Banana Pro is generating AI art, though it's noted that making art more cheerful can sometimes yield unexpected results.
