First up, let's talk about AI and its potential future. To understand if AI is in a bubble, some experts are drawing comparisons to past booms and busts, like the oil industry in the 2010s. Back then, the U.S. became a major oil producer thanks to fracking, but investments took a hit when oil prices dropped. Some believe AI might follow a similar path.

Next, there's an interesting link between AI and energy. AI data centers require a lot of power, much like traditional energy companies. This means AI is now producing a physical commodity with supply and demand dynamics similar to energy markets. As AI grows, it could face challenges similar to those in the energy sector.

Meanwhile, there's a global angle to consider. Just as Saudi Arabia once dominated oil, China could play a similar role in AI with its low-cost technologies. Different regions have their priorities: the U.S. focuses on security, Europe and Canada on climate, and Japan and Korea on supply chain resilience. This could shape how AI develops worldwide.

First up, let's talk about the technodollar. It's all about security, procurement, and carbon standards holding the Western bloc together. Carlyle's Currie points out that while the landscape has changed, the term "monopoly" is now frequently used in discussions about generative AI. Unlike the predictable growth of oil demand, AI is expanding exponentially. The shale revolution succeeded in reshaping global energy but left many investors without returns. AI seems to be following a similar path of abundance without guaranteed profits.

Next, deepfakes are flooding the retail sector. According to Pindrop, three in ten fraud attempts against major retailers are AI-generated. As the holiday season approaches, scammers are using deepfakes to deceive retail employees and steal significant amounts per attack. These AI bots are impersonating loved ones, colleagues, and customers to exploit vulnerabilities in customer service systems. One retailer is facing over a thousand AI-generated calls daily. Despite the robotic nature of these calls, they often succeed by providing legitimate order details.

Meanwhile, deepfake impersonations are becoming a widespread threat. North Korean scammers are using AI to alter their appearances during job interviews at major companies. The FBI has warned about AI being used to mimic senior U.S. officials in phone calls. These tools are only getting more sophisticated, allowing fraudsters to operate around the clock.

Finally, shoppers are also being targeted by deepfakes on social media as they hunt for deals. McAfee's Abhishek Karnik highlights that consumers are being bombarded with these deceptive technologies, adding another layer of complexity to online shopping.

First up, scammers are getting crafty with AI tools, creating fake celebrity endorsements and even imitating stores. Big names like Apple, Amazon, and luxury brands are top targets this shopping season, according to McAfee.

Next, Warner Music and AI music generator Suno have not only partnered up but also settled past legal disputes. This collaboration could shake things up in the music industry.

Meanwhile, Nvidia is making bold claims about its AI chips, stating they’re a generation ahead of Google's tensor processing units. This comes amid speculation that Meta might opt for Google's technology over Nvidia's.
