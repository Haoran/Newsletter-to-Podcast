First up, let's talk about AI's potential future. Picture this: AI is the new oil boom. Industry experts are comparing today's AI surge to past economic booms, like the shale oil explosion of the 2010s. Back then, the U.S. became a top oil producer, but not without some bumps along the way. Heavy investments were followed by a market crash when OPEC stepped in. Some think AI might face a similar path, with big investments and potential risks on the horizon.

Next, there's a fascinating link between AI and energy. As AI grows, so does its need for power, especially for massive data centers. Analyst Jeff Currie points out that companies are shifting from being "asset light" to investing heavily in infrastructure, much like traditional energy companies. This shift highlights a blend of technology and energy, creating what Currie calls "bit-atom" commodities, like AI compute power.

Meanwhile, the global dynamics of AI are drawing comparisons to the energy sector's past. Just as Saudi Arabia played a crucial role in oil, China might become a key player in AI technology. This could lead to a similar narrative, with countries like the U.S. focusing on security and scale, while others prioritize climate goals and supply chain resilience. It's a complex landscape, and experts are watching closely to see how it unfolds.

First up, let's talk about the technodollar and its impact on the Western bloc. The focus here is on security, procurement, and carbon standards. These elements are crucial for maintaining cohesion. Carlyle's Currie points out that today's discussions around monopolies, especially in generative AI, are quite different from the past. Unlike the predictable growth of oil demand, the shale revolution reshaped the global energy landscape but left many investors without returns. AI seems to be following a similar path, offering abundance but with financial challenges.

Next, let's dive into the world of deepfakes and retail fraud. According to Pindrop, three out of ten fraud attempts on major retailers are now AI-generated. As the holiday season approaches, scammers are using deepfakes to deceive retail employees, stealing thousands of dollars per attack on average. These cybercriminals are using AI bots to impersonate people and trick customer service into processing fraudulent refunds. One large retailer is dealing with over 1,000 AI-generated calls daily. Despite some robotic glitches, these bots can provide enough correct information to bypass security checks.

Meanwhile, deepfake technology is being used in various scams, including impersonating people during job interviews and even senior officials in phone calls. The FBI has raised alarms about this growing threat. These AI tools are only getting more sophisticated, making fraud a 24/7 operation. Consumers are also encountering deepfakes while browsing social media for deals, adding another layer of complexity to online shopping.

First up, scammers are getting crafty with AI tools to create fake celebrity endorsements and even mimic stores. McAfee highlights Apple, Amazon, and luxury brands as top targets this shopping season. 

Next, Warner Music and AI music generator Suno have not only partnered up but also settled their past legal disputes. 

Meanwhile, Nvidia is making bold claims about its AI chips, saying they're a generation ahead of Google's. This comes amid speculation that Meta might opt for Google's technology over Nvidia's.
