First up, let's talk about the future of AI and how it might mirror past economic booms and busts. To understand if AI is in a bubble, think about historical parallels like railroads or oil drilling. Industry experts are trying to figure out which past scenario AI might follow. Two analysts, Jeff Currie and Henry Gladwyn, suggest AI's trajectory could resemble the oil exploration boom and bust of the 2010s.

Next, consider the shale boom of the mid-2010s. This period saw the U.S. become a leading oil producer through fracking, but it came with challenges. Heavy investments were made, only for prices to collapse when OPEC moved to regain market share. Some see a similar pattern with AI, where heavy investment could lead to a painful adjustment.

Meanwhile, there's a deeper connection between AI and energy. Natural gas is becoming crucial for powering AI data centers. Currie points out that companies traditionally focused on ideas are now investing heavily in physical assets like data centers, much like energy companies.

Finally, the convergence of computing power and energy is creating new commodities, such as cryptocurrencies and AI compute. The output of AI data centers is so energy-intensive that it's measured similarly to electricity and oil. If low-cost AI technologies from places like China flood the market, it could mirror the oil market dynamics of a decade ago. Each region, from the U.S. to Europe and Asia, has its own priorities, from security to climate and supply chain resilience.

First up, let's talk about the technodollar and its entry rules. The focus is on security, procurement, and carbon standards, which are key to the Western bloc's cohesion. Carlyle's Currie points out a shift in how we discuss monopolies today, especially in the realm of generative AI. Unlike the predictable growth seen in oil markets, AI is experiencing exponential demand. The shale revolution, despite its success in reshaping global energy, left many investors high and dry. AI seems to be following a similar pattern of abundance without guaranteed returns.

Next, deepfakes are becoming a major concern for retailers. According to Pindrop, three out of ten fraud attempts on major retailers are now AI-generated. As we approach the holiday season, scammers are using deepfakes to deceive retail employees, stealing thousands per attack. Cybercriminals are using AI to impersonate loved ones, colleagues, and customers, often targeting customer-service centers with fake refund requests. One large retailer is dealing with over a thousand AI-generated calls daily. These bots sound robotic and sometimes fail to answer questions, but they still manage to trick agents by providing accurate customer information.

Meanwhile, deepfake impersonations are a growing threat across various sectors. North Korean scammers have been using AI to alter their appearances during job interviews with Fortune 500 companies. The FBI has warned about AI being used to impersonate senior U.S. officials in phone calls. These AI tools are improving rapidly, allowing fraudsters to operate around the clock. As shoppers hunt for deals on social media, they're also encountering deepfakes, adding another layer of complexity to online security.

First up, scammers are getting creative with AI tools, crafting fake celebrity endorsements and even mimicking well-known stores. This shopping season, brands like Apple, Amazon, and several luxury names are among the most impersonated, according to McAfee. It's astonishing how quickly these tactics are evolving.

Next, Warner Music and AI music generator Suno have reached a settlement and are now partnering up. This resolution marks a new chapter for both parties after previous legal disputes.

Meanwhile, Nvidia is making bold claims about its AI chips, stating they're a generation ahead of Google's tensor processing units. This comes amid speculation that Meta might opt for Google's technology over Nvidia's.
