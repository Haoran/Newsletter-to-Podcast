First up, let's talk about AI's future and what it might have in common with past industries. To get a sense of whether AI is in a bubble, some experts are comparing it to historical booms and busts like railroads or oil drilling. Although these comparisons aren't perfect, they help us anticipate what might come next. Recently, analysts Jeff Currie and Henry Gladwyn drew parallels between today's AI developments and the oil exploration boom of the 2010s. Back then, the U.S. became a major oil producer thanks to fracking, but heavy investments led to trouble when oil prices collapsed. Some believe AI could face a similar path.

Next, let's explore the connection between AI and energy. Natural gas is becoming crucial for powering AI data centers, which are expensive to operate. Currie points out that companies once focused on ideas now have significant physical assets, like data centers and power plants. This shift marks a convergence of digital and physical commodities, such as cryptocurrencies and AI computing power. These data centers, much like energy companies, must balance supply and demand, which introduces new risks.

Meanwhile, Gladwyn highlights a potential parallel between AI and the oil industry, suggesting that low-cost Chinese AI technologies could play a role similar to Saudi Arabian oil. Different regions have their priorities: the U.S. focuses on security and scale, Europe and Canada on climate concerns, and Japan and Korea on supply chain resilience. These dynamics could shape the future of AI much like they did in the energy sector.

First up, let's talk about the technodollar and its evolving landscape. Security, procurement, and carbon standards are the key factors binding the Western bloc together. Carlyle's Currie points out that while there are similarities to the past, today's discussions around monopolies, especially in the context of generative AI, are unprecedented. Unlike the predictable growth of oil markets, AI is experiencing exponential expansion. The shale revolution succeeded in reshaping global energy but left many investors high and dry. AI seems to be following a similar path of abundant growth.

Next, deepfakes are causing a stir in the retail world. Pindrop estimates that three out of ten fraud attempts targeting major retailers are AI-generated. As we approach the holiday shopping season, scammers are increasingly using deepfakes to deceive corporate employees and steal significant sums per attack. Cybercriminals are leveraging this technology to impersonate loved ones, colleagues, and customers, making fraudulent calls to customer service centers. One major retailer is dealing with over 1,000 AI-generated calls daily. These bots, though sometimes robotic and imperfect, can still provide enough legitimate information to trick agents into processing refunds.

Meanwhile, deepfake impersonations are spreading across the threat landscape. North Korean scammers are using AI tools to alter their appearances and voices during job interviews with Fortune 500 companies. The FBI has also warned of scammers using AI to mimic senior U.S. officials in phone calls. The threat level is rising as these AI tools continue to improve.

Finally, shoppers are being bombarded with deepfakes as they browse social media for deals. According to McAfee's Abhishek Karnik, this technology is being used to manipulate consumers, making it more challenging to distinguish real from fake in the digital marketplace.

First up, scammers are getting crafty with AI tools, creating fake celebrity endorsements and even imitating stores. Big names like Apple, Amazon, and luxury brands are top targets this shopping season, according to McAfee.

Next, Warner Music is teaming up with AI music generator Suno. They've settled past legal issues and are moving forward with this new partnership.

Meanwhile, Nvidia is making bold claims about its AI chips, saying they're "a generation ahead" of Google's tensor processing units. This comes amid speculation that Meta might pick Google over Nvidia for its tech needs.

And that's a wrap on today's updates. Stay tuned for more insights next time.
