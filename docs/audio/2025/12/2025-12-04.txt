First up, let's talk about young professionals and AI. A new survey reveals that nearly all young knowledge workers are using AI at work. But here's the catch: they want AI to be less generic and more personalized to their unique writing and speaking styles. This matters because young workers are often the first to embrace new tech, signaling where trends might head next. Last year, a survey showed a high adoption rate of AI tools among Gen Z and millennials. But now, expectations are higher. A whopping 92% of young leaders want AI that integrates seamlessly with their personal and organizational writing styles. And 90% say they'd use AI more if it felt personalized. Yulie Kwon Kim from Google Workspace notes that while AI-generated emails were once fun, they're now not enough for serious work use. The survey also found that most respondents are power users, actively integrating AI into their workflows, and 93% feel more confident in their skills thanks to AI. However, true personalization is technically challenging, requiring long-term memory and access to sensitive data. This gap presents a big opportunity for AI companies to innovate.

Next, let's shift gears to geothermal energy and AI. A geothermal energy company has made a breakthrough in Nevada with AI's help, discovering the first commercially viable geothermal system in over 30 years. This discovery hints at the potential for AI to revolutionize the energy sector by identifying new resources and improving efficiency. It's an exciting development that could pave the way for more sustainable energy solutions in the future.

First up, let's talk about a promising geothermal discovery in Nevada. Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals has found a significant underground geothermal resource in a remote area. This could be a game-changer for meeting the growing energy demands in the U.S. Geothermal energy is unique because it has support from both sides of the political aisle. Democrats appreciate its zero-emissions, while Republicans value its potential for continuous power supply.

Next, the Nevada site, called "Big Blind," showed no surface signs of geothermal activity. Zanskar used advanced computer models and AI to locate this hidden geothermal hotspot. This approach reduces the number of failed wells, cutting costs and allowing for more precise drilling. It's a method similar to how other natural resource industries have evolved over time.

Meanwhile, Zanskar has also been working on other geothermal sites in Nevada and New Mexico. Unlike Big Blind, these sites had some known geothermal activity but hadn't been fully explored. The company now plans to develop Big Blind into a commercial power source, aiming for it to be operational later this decade.

Looking at the bigger picture, the International Energy Agency suggests geothermal could meet a significant portion of global power demand by 2050. However, this will require more government support and specialized labor. Notably, geothermal energy has strong backing from Congress and the previous Trump administration, with tax incentives preserved to encourage its development.

Finally, in the tech world, Micron is shifting its focus from consumer products to supplying AI data centers. Meanwhile, Meta has recruited a top Apple design executive to lead a new lab focused on integrating design, fashion, and technology. And OpenAI is acquiring Neptune, a Polish startup that enhances AI model training.

First up, Salesforce has surprised analysts with a strong earnings report and an optimistic forecast, exceeding expectations and boosting confidence in its future performance.

Next, Snowflake's outlook on profit margins didn't quite meet some projections, leaving investors with mixed feelings about its financial trajectory.

Meanwhile, 1980s pop singer Tiffany is enjoying a comeback. Her song "I Think We're Alone Now" is featured in the new season of "Stranger Things," making it the most searched-for track on Shazam.
