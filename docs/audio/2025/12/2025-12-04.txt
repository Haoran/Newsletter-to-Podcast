First up, young professionals are pushing for better AI tools at work. A new survey reveals that workers under 40 want AI to be more personalized, reflecting their unique writing and speaking styles. These young leaders, often at the forefront of tech adoption, are setting the pace for where AI is headed. Last year, a survey found that a vast majority of Gen Z and millennials were already using multiple AI tools weekly. Now, 92% of them are calling for AI that integrates seamlessly with their personal work data, like emails and meeting notes. Google Workspace's VP of Product, Yulie Kwon Kim, notes that expectations for AI have risen. It’s not enough for AI to just draft emails; it needs to feel authentic and tailored. However, achieving true personalization is complex, requiring sophisticated systems that many current AI solutions aren't equipped to handle. This gap presents a significant opportunity for AI developers to step up.

Next, a breakthrough in geothermal energy has been announced. Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals, with the help of AI, has discovered the first commercially viable geothermal system in over three decades. This find, located in western Nevada, could signal a promising future for geothermal energy as a viable solution to meet the increasing energy demands in the U.S. This development underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize energy exploration and production, offering new avenues for sustainable energy sources.

First up, let's talk about geothermal energy. It's one of those rare energy sources that both Democrats and Republicans agree on. Democrats love its zero-emissions benefits, while Republicans are excited about its potential for consistent power. Recently, a site in Nevada called Big Blind was discovered by Zanskar scientists using AI to pinpoint geothermal activity without any obvious surface signs. This tech-driven approach reduces the risk and cost of drilling by targeting more precise locations.

Next, Zanskar's AI technology is making waves in the geothermal industry. Co-founders Joel Edwards and Carl Hoiland explain that this method is similar to advancements in oil and gas exploration, where deeper and more accurate targeting has become the norm. The Big Blind site is just one of several projects, including Pumpernickel and Lightning Dock, where Zanskar is exploring geothermal potential.

Meanwhile, the company is gearing up to turn Big Blind into a commercial power source by the end of the decade. The International Energy Agency sees geothermal as a key player in meeting future power demands, but it will need more government support and skilled labor to reach its full potential. In the U.S., geothermal energy continues to receive strong backing from Congress and the Trump administration, with tax incentives still in place to encourage development.

Finally, looking at the broader tech landscape, Micron is shifting its focus from consumer products to supplying AI data centers. Meta has brought on a top Apple designer to lead a new lab focused on merging design and technology. OpenAI is expanding by acquiring a Polish startup to enhance AI model training. Meanwhile, Salesforce reports strong earnings, though Snowflake's profit margins aren't quite meeting expectations.

First up, 1980s pop singer Tiffany is enjoying a comeback. Her hit song "I Think We're Alone Now" is gaining new popularity after being featured in the latest season of Stranger Things. It's now one of the most searched-for tracks on Shazam.
