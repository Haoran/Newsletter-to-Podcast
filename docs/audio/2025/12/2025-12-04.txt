First up, let's dive into the world of AI and young professionals. A new survey reveals that almost all young knowledge workers are using AI at work, but they're looking for more. Workers under 40 want AI that's less generic and more personalized, reflecting their unique writing and speaking styles. This matters because these young professionals are often the first to adopt new tech, hinting at future trends. Last year, a survey showed that a vast majority of Gen Z and millennials were using multiple AI tools weekly. But as AI adoption accelerates, the novelty is fading. Now, 92% of young leaders want AI that integrates seamlessly with their personal work information, like emails and meeting notes. Google Workspace's Yulie Kwon Kim notes that expectations have risen; AI needs to do more than just generate documents. In a recent survey of young U.S. knowledge workers, 77% said they actively design their workflows with AI, and 93% feel more confident in their skills thanks to AI. However, making AI truly personalized is technically challenging, as it requires handling sensitive data and long-term memory. This is a gap that AI companies could fill, offering a more authentic experience for users.

Next, let's talk about a groundbreaking AI discovery in geothermal energy. In western Nevada, a geothermal energy company has announced a major breakthrough. With the help of AI, they've discovered the first commercially viable geothermal system in over 30 years. This hints at a promising future for sustainable energy solutions.

First up, let's talk about a promising geothermal discovery in Nevada. Officials at Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals have uncovered a significant underground heat source in a remote area, suggesting geothermal energy could be a key player in meeting the rising U.S. energy demand. This energy source is unique because it enjoys support from both political parties, with Democrats appreciating its zero emissions and Republicans valuing its potential for continuous power supply.

Next, the discovery, known as "Big Blind," showed no surface signs of geothermal activity. Zanskar scientists used advanced computer models and AI to pinpoint this geothermal anomaly, resulting in fewer unsuccessful drilling attempts and lower project costs. Co-founders Joel Edwards and Carl Hoiland highlight how AI allows them to target resources more accurately, drawing parallels to advancements in other natural-resource industries.

Meanwhile, this isn't Zanskar's first venture. They've previously explored sites in northern Nevada and New Mexico, but Big Blind stands out due to its lack of prior exploration. The company aims to develop this site into a commercial power source by the end of the decade.

Looking at the bigger picture, the International Energy Agency believes geothermal energy could meet a significant portion of global power demand by 2050, but it will require more government support and specialized labor. Despite recent cuts to renewable energy tax credits, geothermal incentives remain intact, signaling strong backing from Congress and the Trump administration.

Finally, the takeaway here is that while many think natural systems are fully tapped, discoveries like Big Blind suggest there's much more potential to be unlocked. This could be just the beginning of a new wave in geothermal energy.
