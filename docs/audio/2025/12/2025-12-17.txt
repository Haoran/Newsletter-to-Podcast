First up, let's talk naps and brain size. A new study suggests that daytime napping is linked to a larger brain. However, it’s not clear if napping causes this growth. So, more data is needed to understand this connection fully.

Next, the battle between OpenAI and Google heats up with a new update from ChatGPT Images. OpenAI has launched a tool that not only edits but also generates images, aiming to keep pace with Google's impressive Nano Banana. This update promises faster image generation and more precise edits. It's integrated into ChatGPT, making it a potential rival to Adobe's photo editing dominance. Industry experts predict this competition will continue into next year, benefiting both businesses and consumers but challenging AI companies to maintain their rapid innovation.

Meanwhile, as the year winds down, more AI model releases are expected before a brief pause for the holidays. OpenAI teased its latest release with a playful nod to its CEO, hinting at exciting developments ahead.

Finally, on the job front, AI is proving the doomers wrong by creating more employment opportunities. Rather than eliminating jobs, AI is generating new work and roles, at least for now. This is a positive sign for those concerned about AI's impact on the job market.

First up, there's a more optimistic angle on AI in the workplace. Vanguard's latest analysis shows that jobs most exposed to AI have seen both wage and job growth over the past two years, outpacing those with less exposure.

Next, a survey reveals that most institutional investors and CEOs anticipate AI will boost hiring across all levels by 2026. Despite a slowdown in the job market, the blame is more on macroeconomic factors than AI itself. Economist Martha Gimbel points out that recent federal job cuts and immigration policies are also playing a role.

Meanwhile, Vanguard's deep dive into a Labor Department database highlights that jobs with high AI exposure, like data analysis, saw real wages rise by 3.8% and job growth by 1.7%. AI is making work more productive, allowing people to focus on higher-value tasks.

Zooming out, this isn't the first time tech advancements have spurred new job creation. Remember the iPhone's launch? It birthed an entire app-based economy. However, we're still early in the AI transition, and the tech is evolving rapidly.

Finally, much of the current AI investment is in infrastructure, not hiring. Amazon and OpenAI are discussing a $10 billion investment, and OpenAI's GPT-5 model is showing promise in scientific experiments. Meanwhile, Google is testing an AI assistant for managing Gmail and Google Calendar. The AI boom is also affecting memory prices and availability for tech devices.

First up, over the weekend in Washington, D.C., more than 1,400 couples came together for a massive simultaneous kiss. Their goal? To break the world record for the most people kissing under the mistletoe in one location.
