First up, let's talk about Google. The tech giant is making waves in the AI world, showing signs of a strong comeback. This comes as the industry faces a reality check, with companies spending big but not yet seeing the profits. The stakes are high, and the winners and losers will soon emerge.

Next, Meta is in the spotlight. Known for its groundbreaking work with ChatGPT, the company is now in a "code red" mode. They're scrambling to respond to the latest Gemini model, which could be released this week. Meta is undergoing a major transformation, hoping a new model will help them catch up after their Llama models fell behind.

Meanwhile, Anthropic is quietly making its mark. While not a household name, its Claude model is popular among coders and businesses. A new deal with Accenture highlights its potential to grow without the consumer buzz. Like others, Anthropic needs to expand quickly and may consider a 2026 IPO to support its ambitions.

Finally, OpenAI remains a key player. Despite challenges, it's still the one to beat, especially from a consumer perspective. The race is on to see who can turn their AI innovations into profitable ventures first.
