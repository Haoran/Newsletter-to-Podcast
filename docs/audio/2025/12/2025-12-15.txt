First up, let's talk about AI in the workplace. According to recent Gallup data, AI usage is on the rise across various industries. Tech workers lead the way, with usage jumping from 20% to 50% between 2023 and 2025. Finance and education sectors are also seeing significant increases. Despite fears about job security, more professionals are integrating AI into their daily routines. However, daily usage remains low, with only 10% of workers using AI every day. The trend is clear: the higher your position, the more likely you are to use AI, with chatbots being the most popular tool.

OpenAI is a cornerstone of the AI economy, and its stability is crucial for many stakeholders. Altman is sharpening the focus on enhancing ChatGPT amidst these pressures. While technical failures seem unlikely, the complexity of business deals and a shaky labor market are causing some investor concerns.
