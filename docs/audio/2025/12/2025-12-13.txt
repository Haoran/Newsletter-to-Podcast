First up, OpenAI is raising alarms about the growing cyber risks posed by its advanced AI models. They’ve noticed these models are getting better at operating autonomously, which could expand the number of people capable of launching cyberattacks. In a recent report, OpenAI highlighted that their latest models achieved impressive scores in cybersecurity exercises, signaling a potential increase in cyber capabilities. They’re preparing for new models to reach high levels of cybersecurity capability, which could pose significant risks. OpenAI is taking steps to address these concerns, including forming a Frontier Risk Council to collaborate with cyber defense experts and testing a tool called Aardvark to help developers find security vulnerabilities.

Next, Wall Street is gearing up for a potential $3 trillion IPO wave.

First up, some of the world's largest startups, including major players in AI, are eyeing potential IPOs next year. These offerings could create around $3 trillion in new public companies, despite their current lack of profit. With the market's fixation on AI, there's a risk of repeating the dot-com bubble mistakes. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, is planning to go public with a record-breaking $1.5 trillion valuation. OpenAI, with an implied value over $500 billion, is also stirring IPO speculation.

Next, other tech giants in AI, crypto, and frontier technologies are considering going public by 2026. This includes OpenAI's competitor, Anthropic. With markets near all-time highs, investor enthusiasm for AI, space, and crypto is strong. However, there's a growing concern about a potential bubble in AI stocks. Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers advises taking advantage of the current market excitement, but warns that even slight weakness in AI shares can make investors nervous.

Meanwhile, Oracle's big investment in AI data centers hasn't paid off as expected. Their shares dropped over 10% after disappointing quarterly results. Jay Ritter from the University of Florida cautions that if valuations become too inflated, we might see another WeWork scenario, where initial high valuations don't hold up, leading to significant fallout.

Finally, the potential IPO surge could have mixed outcomes. While some companies might underperform, others could become the next big success stories like Nvidia or Alphabet. Sosnick emphasizes that public offerings allow everyday investors to share in corporate growth. On a lighter note, In-N-Out has stopped using order number 67 to prevent chaos among younger customers, while Arby's seems unfazed by youthful antics.
