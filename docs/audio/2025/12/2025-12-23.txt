Happy holidays! Ina and this newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI+.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a split over the future of AI as the 2028 elections approach. Party leaders and potential candidates are divided on how to handle AI, a key issue that could shape the economy and workforce if Democrats reclaim the White House.

Next, within the party, two main arguments are emerging. Some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and capitalize on job opportunities from new data centers. Others, however, are calling for more regulation to address the potential job displacement and environmental impact.

Meanwhile, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI companies, highlighting the economic benefits and job creation in their states. Shapiro has emphasized AI's role in competing with China, while Whitmer celebrated a major OpenAI project expected to bring thousands of jobs to Michigan.

On the other hand, progressive Democrats such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are pushing for stricter regulations. They're concerned about protecting workers and managing AI's rapid growth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has even called for a halt on building new data centers until regulations are in place.

Finally, the debate within the Democratic Party highlights a critical policy challenge as they look toward the 2028 elections, with significant implications for America's AI strategy and its impact on the workforce.

First up, there's growing concern around AI chatbots and their impact on children, with claims that they're contributing to tragic outcomes. Meanwhile, AI data centers are under fire for driving up electricity costs and polluting local areas. Some unions are embracing AI, but others are pushing back, fearing job losses. The Teamsters are demanding that self-driving trucks still have human operators onboard, a stance supported by some Democrats like Senator John Fetterman. However, not all politicians are taking a stand, with Pennsylvania's governor staying silent on the issue.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI. Despite recent declines in tech stocks, Wall Street optimists see these as healthy adjustments. They argue that high valuations are justified, especially for companies like Nvidia, which is experiencing significant sales growth. Analysts suggest that the current cautious investor approach is beneficial, as demand for AI continues to rise, evidenced by ChatGPT's record user numbers.

Meanwhile, concerns about data centers being overbuilt are being addressed. Local officials are stepping in to regulate growth, which some see as a positive development for the market. Additionally, while tech firms are spending heavily on AI infrastructure, experts argue that this investment is crucial for future growth. They predict significant capital expenditure in the coming years, viewing it as a necessary step to thrive in the AI revolution.

Finally, the question of AI profitability looms large. The key to making money lies in monetization strategies, likely through advertising, with OpenAI expected to lead the charge soon. New product releases are also anticipated to open up further opportunities for revenue.

First up, OpenAI is making moves in the business world. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer, signaling a strong push to engage more with enterprises. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that we might be witnessing the early signs of an AI bubble bursting, despite attempts to spin negative signals into positives.

Next, the market dynamics are shifting with the AI revolution. Traditional investing rules might not apply anymore, as strategists suggest we rethink our approach in light of these changes.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is set to acquire Intersect, a data center company, for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing race among AI firms to secure the power needed for energy-intensive data centers.

Finally, AI is not just reshaping industries but also impacting childhood, and the necessary safety measures aren't keeping pace. An investigation by 404 Media reveals that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are being livestreamed online without requiring a password or login, raising serious privacy concerns.
