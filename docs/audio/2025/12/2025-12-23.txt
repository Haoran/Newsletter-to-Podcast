Happy holidays, everyone! We'll be back in your inbox on January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's top story.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a divide over AI policy as we look toward the 2028 elections. The future of AI is becoming a hot topic, with potential presidential candidates and party leaders taking different stances. If Democrats regain the White House, their position on AI could significantly impact the economy and workforce.

On one side, some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and capitalize on job opportunities from new data centers. This view aligns somewhat with the Trump administration's approach, though Democrats criticize the current White House for giving AI companies too much freedom. Others in the party call for slowing down and implementing stricter regulations to address AI's potential to displace workers and the environmental impact of data centers.

Governors from key swing states, like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, are welcoming AI companies with open arms. Shapiro has highlighted AI investments in Pennsylvania, while Whitmer celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs. Labor unions, particularly in construction, are also embracing the potential job growth from AI.

Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, including New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California's Ro Khanna, are pushing for more government regulation to protect workers. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders even called for a halt on building new data centers until proper regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't explicitly backed a moratorium but has emphasized the need for congressional action to address public health concerns related to AI.

That's it for today's briefing. We'll keep an eye on how this debate unfolds.

First up, there's growing concern over AI's impact on society. Some argue that AI chatbots are contributing to tragic outcomes for children, while AI data centers are driving up electricity costs and polluting communities. Unions are divided; some fear job losses, while others are finding ways to adapt.

Next, the Teamsters are pushing for regulations on self-driving trucks, insisting a human should always be present. This stance is supported by some Democrats like Senator John Fetterman, but not everyone is on board. Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro's team, for instance, is staying mum on the issue.

Meanwhile, Wall Street is bullish on AI's future, despite some challenges. High stock valuations? Analysts argue they're justified, especially with companies like Nvidia showing massive growth potential. While tech stocks aren't soaring as before, this selectivity is seen as a healthy sign.

Demand for AI is undeniable, with ChatGPT hitting a record 800 million weekly users. Concerns about data center overbuilding are being addressed by local officials, who are capping growth to maintain balance in the market.

Finally, the question of AI profitability looms. Analysts believe monetization will come through advertising, with OpenAI expected to lead the charge soon. New product releases could also unlock more revenue streams, ensuring AI's role in the future economy.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to work more closely with businesses. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer, signaling a strong push to expand their enterprise sales. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the AI market might be showing signs of a bubble, suggesting we should be cautious about overly optimistic interpretations.

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional market strategies. The AI revolution is changing the game, and the old business school investing rules might not apply anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company Alphabet is set to acquire data center firm Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing race among AI companies to secure the power needed for their energy-intensive data centers.

Finally, AI's impact is reaching into unexpected areas, including childhood experiences. Concerns are growing about the lack of safety measures, as seen with Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras, which an investigation found to be accessible online without any security barriers.
