Happy holidays, everyone! We'll be back in your ears on Monday, January 5th. 

First up, let's talk about the Democratic Party's growing divide over AI as we look toward the 2028 elections. The party is split on how to handle the future of artificial intelligence, which could have major implications for the economy and the workforce if they regain the White House. 

On one side, some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and create jobs through new data centers. Leaders like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI companies with open arms, highlighting significant investments and job creation in their states. Labor unions are also on board, seeing potential benefits for their members.

Meanwhile, progressive Democrats like New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California's Ro Khanna are sounding the alarm. They're calling for stricter regulations to protect workers who might be displaced by AI advancements. Vermont's Bernie Sanders is even pushing for a halt on building new data centers until there's more oversight.

So, as we head toward 2028, the Democratic Party is wrestling with how to balance innovation with regulation in the AI space. It's a debate that will shape their policy and potentially the country's technological future.

First up, there's growing concern over AI's impact on society. Some argue that AI chatbots are contributing to tragic outcomes among children, while AI data centers are driving up electricity costs and causing pollution. Unions are divided on AI, with some fearing job losses. The Teamsters are pushing for human operators in self-driving trucks, gaining support from some Democrats like Senator John Fetterman, though others remain silent.

Next, let's talk about AI's financial future. Despite some tech stock declines, Wall Street remains optimistic about AI's potential. Analysts argue that companies like Nvidia are undervalued given their growth prospects. While tech stocks aren't rallying as they once did, this is seen as a sign of healthy investor caution. Demand for AI is strong, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching a record 800 million users weekly.

Meanwhile, concerns about overbuilt data centers are being addressed. Local officials are starting to limit growth, which some see as a positive market correction. The massive spending on AI infrastructure is viewed as an investment in future growth. Analysts predict significant capital expenditure in AI by 2040, suggesting long-term confidence in the sector.

Finally, the question of AI profitability looms. Monetization is expected to come from advertising, with OpenAI likely leading the charge soon. New product releases are anticipated to open up further revenue opportunities, signaling a promising financial horizon for AI.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to expand its business reach. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer. This signals a strong push to attract more enterprise clients. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the AI hype might be overblown, suggesting we could be seeing the start of an AI bubble burst.

Next, traditional investment strategies might need a rethink. With the AI revolution changing the game, strategists are advising to set aside old business school rules as the market dynamics evolve.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is set to acquire Intersect, a data center company, for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing demand for power to support energy-intensive AI data centers.

Finally, AI is already having a significant impact, including on childhood experiences, but safety measures haven't caught up. An investigation revealed that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are broadcasting online without requiring any login, raising privacy concerns.
