Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and this newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. Today’s AI+ is a quick read at 4.5 minutes.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a divide over AI policy as we look towards the 2028 elections. This debate is crucial because if Democrats regain the White House, their stance on AI will influence the nation’s economic future and workforce.

Next, within the party, two main perspectives have emerged. Some Democrats argue for embracing AI to stay competitive with China and capitalize on job opportunities from new data centers. Others believe in slowing down and imposing more regulations due to AI's potential to displace workers and its environmental impact.

Meanwhile, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI companies, highlighting the economic benefits and job creation. Shapiro has emphasized Pennsylvania's role in AI development, while Whitmer celebrated a major AI project in Michigan for its job prospects.

On the other hand, progressive Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna are pushing for stricter regulations to protect workers. Bernie Sanders has even called for a pause on building new data centers until more oversight is in place, citing public health concerns.

Finally, the debate within the Democratic Party over AI policy is set to be a significant issue in the upcoming 2028 primaries, with potential long-term impacts on the U.S. economy and workforce.

First up, there's growing concern about AI's impact on society. Some say AI chatbots are contributing to tragic outcomes among children and that data centers are driving up electricity costs and polluting communities. While some unions are cautiously embracing AI, others fear it will replace jobs. The Teamsters, for instance, want self-driving trucks to always have a human operator onboard. This stance has gained support from some Democrats, like Senator John Fetterman, though not everyone is speaking up.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some declines in tech stocks, Wall Street remains optimistic, viewing these as healthy movements. Analysts argue that high valuations are justified, especially for companies like Nvidia, which is expected to see significant sales growth. While tech stocks aren't rallying wildly, this is seen as a sign that investors are becoming more selective, which is considered positive.

Meanwhile, concerns about AI demand and data center growth are being reframed. OpenAI's ChatGPT is breaking user records, indicating strong demand. And while data centers are expanding rapidly, local officials are stepping in to regulate growth, which some see as a beneficial check on the market.

Finally, there's the question of whether AI will be profitable. Analysts believe monetization will come through advertising, with OpenAI expected to lead the way next year. New product releases are also anticipated to create more opportunities for revenue, suggesting a promising future for AI investments.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to expand its business reach. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as chief revenue officer, signaling a shift towards selling more to enterprises. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the AI bubble might be showing signs of bursting, despite attempts to spin negative signals positively.

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional investing strategies. The AI revolution is changing market rules, so those old business school textbooks might not be as relevant anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is set to acquire data center firm Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing race among AI companies to secure the power needed for their energy-intensive data centers.

Finally, there's growing concern about AI's impact on childhood and safety. An investigation by 404 Media revealed that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are livestreamed online without requiring a password or login, raising questions about privacy and security.
