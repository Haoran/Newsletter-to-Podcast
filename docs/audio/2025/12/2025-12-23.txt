Happy holidays, everyone! We'll be back with more updates on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI news.

First up, the Democratic Party is split over the future of AI as we look toward the 2028 elections. This divide could significantly influence how the U.S. handles AI, impacting both the economy and the workforce. 

On one side, some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and secure jobs linked to new data centers. Leaders like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI investments, highlighting projects that promise job creation and economic growth. Shapiro has positioned Pennsylvania as a future AI hub, while Whitmer celebrates a major OpenAI project expected to bring thousands of jobs to Michigan.

Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna, are advocating for stricter AI regulations. They emphasize the need to protect workers from displacement and address environmental concerns. Bernie Sanders even suggests halting new data center construction until regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez has highlighted the public health risks of unregulated AI development.

That's the latest on the Democrats' AI debate. Stay tuned for more updates in the new year!

First up, there's growing concern over AI's impact on society. Some argue that AI chatbots may be contributing to tragic outcomes among children, while the rise of AI data centers is driving up electricity costs and polluting communities. Unions are divided on AI; some see potential benefits, but others fear job losses. The Teamsters are demanding human operators in self-driving trucks, a stance supported by some Democrats like Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, though not all politicians are voicing their opinions.

Next, let's talk about AI's financial outlook. Despite concerns about high stock valuations and overbuilt data centers, Wall Street experts remain optimistic. They argue that the AI sector is still in its early stages, with companies like Nvidia expected to see significant growth. Analysts suggest that current stock valuations might actually be undervalued given the potential for future sales growth.

Meanwhile, tech stocks aren't rallying as wildly as before, which some see as a sign of a more discerning market. AI demand continues to rise, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching a record number of users. Local officials are beginning to regulate data center growth, which some analysts believe is a healthy check on the market.

Finally, there's the question of AI's profitability. While tech firms are heavily investing in AI infrastructure, experts argue this spending is essential for future growth. Monetization is expected to come through advertising and new product releases, with OpenAI likely leading the charge next year. The belief is that these investments will eventually pay off as the AI revolution unfolds.

First up, OpenAI is making moves in the business world. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer. This signals a strong push to expand their enterprise sales. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that despite positive spins, signs of an AI bubble bursting might already be appearing.

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional market rules. The AI revolution is changing the game, so those old business school investing textbooks might not apply anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is set to acquire Intersect, a data center company, for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing race among AI firms to secure the power needed for energy-demanding data centers.

Finally, AI is not just reshaping industries but also impacting childhood. Concerns are rising about safety, as seen with Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras, which reportedly stream live on the internet without requiring a password or login.
