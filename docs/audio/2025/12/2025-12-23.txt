Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and this newsletter will return on January 5th. Let's dive into today's updates.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a divide over the future of AI as we look towards the 2028 elections. This debate could shape how the U.S. handles AI, impacting the economy and workforce significantly. 

Two main camps are emerging within the party. Some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and secure jobs from new data centers. Meanwhile, others call for slowing down and increasing regulation to address potential job displacement and resource consumption.

Next, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro is optimistic about AI's role in Pennsylvania's future and its potential to rival China. Whitmer recently celebrated a major AI project in Michigan, which promises thousands of jobs, both in construction and high-skill roles.

Meanwhile, labor unions, particularly in the building trades, are partnering with AI companies, seeing job opportunities for their members. Brent Booker of the Laborers' International Union emphasizes the need for responsible planning and union labor in constructing data centers.

Finally, on the other side of the debate, progressive Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are pushing for strong regulations to protect workers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders even called for a halt on building new data centers until regulations catch up. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the public health risks of unregulated AI development during a recent congressional hearing.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates in the new year!

First up, there's growing concern over AI's impact on society. Some believe AI chatbots are contributing to tragic outcomes among children, while the rise of AI data centers is driving up electricity costs and affecting local communities. Unions are divided on AI; some fear job losses, while others see potential benefits. The Teamsters are pushing for human operators in self-driving trucks, gaining support from some Democrats, like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, though not all politicians are vocal on the issue.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some declines in tech stocks and concerns about overbuilding data centers, Wall Street remains optimistic. Analysts argue that high valuations are justified, especially for companies like Nvidia, which is expected to see significant sales growth. While tech stocks aren't rallying as they once did, this is seen as a sign of a healthier, more selective market.

Meanwhile, demand for AI continues to rise, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching a record 800 million weekly users. Local officials are also stepping in to regulate data center growth, which some experts view as a positive development for the market. 

Finally, there's debate over the massive spending on AI infrastructure. Top tech firms are investing heavily, using cash that was previously idle. This spending is seen as essential for future growth and staying competitive in the AI revolution. Looking ahead, monetization through advertising and new product releases is expected to generate revenue, with OpenAI likely leading the charge as early as next year.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to attract more business clients. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer. This signals a strong push to expand their enterprise reach. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that what might seem like positive news could actually be signs of an AI bubble starting to burst. 

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional market rules. The AI revolution is changing the game, so those old business school investing textbooks might not be as relevant anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring Intersect, a data center company, for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the fierce competition among AI firms to secure the power needed for energy-intensive data centers.

Finally, AI is already having a big impact on childhood, but safety measures aren't keeping up. A recent investigation found that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are livestreamed online without requiring a password or login, raising serious privacy concerns.
