Happy holidays, everyone! We'll be back in your inbox on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI news.

First up, there's a growing divide in the Democratic Party over the future of artificial intelligence. As we look ahead to the 2028 elections, potential candidates and party leaders are already taking sides on this critical issue. The outcome could significantly impact the economy and workforce if Democrats regain the White House.

On one side, some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and secure jobs from new data centers. Governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI investments, highlighting economic benefits and job creation. Shapiro has emphasized Pennsylvania's role in AI development, while Whitmer celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs.

Meanwhile, some progressive Democrats are urging caution. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna, along with Senator Bernie Sanders, are advocating for stricter regulations to protect workers from potential job displacement. Sanders even called for a halt on building new data centers until proper regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez has also highlighted the public health risks of unregulated AI development.

So, as Democrats debate AI's future, the stakes are high for both the party and the nation.

First up, there's growing concern about AI's impact on society. AI chatbots are being blamed for tragic outcomes among children, while AI data centers are driving up electricity costs and polluting communities. Some unions are warming to AI, but others fear job losses. The Teamsters are demanding human operators in self-driving trucks, a stance backed by some Democrats like Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, though not all politicians are speaking up.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some declines in tech stocks, Wall Street remains optimistic about AI's potential. Analysts argue that companies like Nvidia are undervalued given their growth prospects. While tech stocks aren't rallying as they once did, this is seen as a sign of a more discerning market. Meanwhile, AI demand is booming, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly users.

Meanwhile, concerns about data center overbuilding are being addressed as local officials push back, creating a natural limit on growth. This is seen as a positive development for the market. Tech firms are heavily investing in AI infrastructure, which is expected to drive future growth. Analysts predict significant capital expenditure, with $1.2 trillion expected by 2040.

Finally, the question of AI's profitability hinges on monetization strategies. Advertising is likely to be a key revenue stream, with OpenAI expected to lead the way. New product releases are also anticipated to open up further monetization opportunities.

First up, OpenAI is making moves in the business world. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer, signaling a push to attract more enterprise clients. But some experts, like venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky, caution that the AI market might be showing signs of a bubble.

Next, let's talk about the shifting market landscape. With the AI revolution underway, strategists suggest it's time to rethink traditional investing strategies. The old rules might not apply anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is making a big acquisition. They're buying data center company Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing demand for power to support energy-intensive AI data centers.

Finally, there's a growing concern about AI's impact on safety and privacy. An investigation revealed that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are streaming live on the internet without any password protection. This raises questions about the adequacy of current safety measures.
