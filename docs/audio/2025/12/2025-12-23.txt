Happy holidays! Ina and the newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI+.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a split over AI policy as we look ahead to 2028. This debate could significantly impact the economy and job market if Democrats reclaim the White House. The party is divided between those who want to embrace AI to compete with China and boost job creation, and those who advocate for more regulation due to concerns about job displacement and resource consumption.

Next, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI companies with open arms. Shapiro has positioned Pennsylvania as a key player in the AI race against China, while Whitmer celebrated a major OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs. Labor unions are also on board, emphasizing the need for responsible planning and union labor in constructing data centers.

Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, including New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California's Ro Khanna, are pushing for stricter regulations on AI. They highlight the risks of job displacement and call for protective measures. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has even suggested a pause on building new data centers until regulations catch up, echoing concerns about the rapid, unchecked growth of AI technology.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates when we return in January.

First up, there's growing concern over AI chatbots and their impact on society. Some say they're contributing to tragic outcomes for children and driving up electricity costs due to data centers. While a few unions are embracing AI, others are pushing back, fearing job losses. The Teamsters are demanding that self-driving trucks still have human operators, a stance supported by some Democrats like Senator John Fetterman. However, not everyone is speaking out, including Pennsylvania's governor, who remains silent on the issue.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some declines in tech stocks and concerns about data center overbuilding, Wall Street remains optimistic. They argue that high valuations are justified and that we're just at the beginning of the AI revolution. Analysts point out that companies like Nvidia, with significant sales growth, are actually undervalued. Meanwhile, the demand for AI continues to grow, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly users.

Meanwhile, there's a debate around the rapid expansion of data centers. Some local officials are starting to limit their growth, which experts say is a healthy market correction. The spending on AI infrastructure is also under scrutiny. Top tech firms are investing heavily, using cash that was previously idle, to fuel future growth. Analysts predict substantial capital expenditure in AI, seeing it as essential for surviving the AI revolution.

Finally, the question remains: will AI be profitable? The answer seems to lie in monetization strategies, particularly through advertising. OpenAI is expected to lead the charge, with new product releases likely to open up more revenue opportunities in the near future.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to expand its business reach. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as chief revenue officer, signaling a focus on selling to more enterprises. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the AI bubble might be showing signs of bursting, despite efforts to spin negative signals positively.

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional investing rules. The AI revolution is changing market dynamics, so those old business school textbooks might not apply anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company Alphabet is acquiring data center firm Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move is part of a larger trend where AI companies are aggressively seeking the power needed for energy-hungry data centers.

Finally, AI is already having a big impact on childhood, but safety measures are lacking. An investigation by 404 Media found that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are being livestreamed online without any password protection, raising privacy concerns.
