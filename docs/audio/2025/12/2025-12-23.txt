Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and this newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI+ update.

First up, there's a growing divide within the Democratic Party over the future of AI. As we look ahead to the 2028 elections, party leaders and potential presidential candidates are already staking out differing positions on this crucial issue. If Democrats regain the White House, their stance on AI will have significant implications for the economy and workforce.

Here's the big picture: Within the party, two main arguments are emerging. Some Democrats believe embracing AI is essential to outpace China and secure the jobs associated with new data centers. They argue this aligns with the Trump administration's approach, although they feel the current White House is too lenient with AI companies. On the flip side, other Democrats urge caution, advocating for more regulation due to AI's potential to displace workers and its environmental impact.

Next, let's look at some key players. Swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, both eyeing 2028, are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro has positioned Pennsylvania as a future AI hub, while Whitmer celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs. Labor unions, particularly in construction, are also optimistic about the job opportunities AI investments could bring.

Meanwhile, progressive Democrats like New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California's Ro Khanna are more critical of the AI industry's rapid growth. They're calling for strong government regulations to protect workers at risk of displacement. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has even suggested a pause on building new data centers until regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't explicitly supported a moratorium but highlighted the public health risks of unchecked AI development during a recent congressional hearing.

That's the latest on the Democratic Party's AI debate. Stay tuned as this conversation continues to evolve.

First up, there's growing concern over AI chatbots. Some argue they're having a devastating impact on young people, while AI data centers are driving up electricity costs and causing pollution. Unions are divided on AI; some see potential, while others fear job losses. The Teamsters are pushing for human operators in self-driving trucks, gaining support from figures like Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, though not everyone is speaking out.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some challenges, Wall Street remains optimistic. Analysts argue that high stock valuations and tech spending are justified. Nvidia, for instance, is expected to see significant growth, making it undervalued compared to its potential. 

Meanwhile, tech stocks aren't rallying as they once did, which some see as a sign of a more discerning market. Demand for AI remains strong, with ChatGPT hitting a record 800 million weekly users. Concerns about overbuilt data centers are being addressed as local officials look to regulate growth, which some view as a positive development.

Finally, there's the question of AI's profitability. Analysts believe monetization will come through advertising, possibly led by OpenAI next year. New product releases are also expected to open up more revenue streams, supporting the idea that AI spending is an investment in future growth.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to engage more with businesses. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as chief revenue officer, signaling a focus on enterprise sales. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that what might look like positive momentum could actually be signs of an AI bubble starting to burst.

Next, strategists are saying it's time to rethink traditional market strategies. The AI revolution is changing the rules, so those old business school investing textbooks might not apply anymore.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring data center firm Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing demand for power to support energy-intensive AI data centers.

Finally, AI is already impacting childhood, but safety measures are lagging behind. An investigation revealed that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are streaming live on the internet without any password protection, raising significant privacy concerns.
