Happy holidays! Ina and this newsletter will return on January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's focus.

First up, there's a growing divide within the Democratic Party over the future of AI, which is already shaping the 2028 primary landscape. This debate is crucial because if Democrats reclaim the White House, their stance on AI will significantly influence the nation's approach to this transformative technology, impacting both the economy and the workforce.

Here's what's happening: Democrats are split between two major viewpoints. Some argue that embracing AI is essential to outpace China and secure jobs linked to the data centers AI companies are building. This perspective aligns somewhat with the Trump administration's approach, though Democrats criticize the current level of freedom given to AI companies.

On the flip side, there's a call for slowing down and implementing stricter regulations on the AI industry. This camp is concerned about AI's potential to displace millions of workers and the environmental impact of new data centers.

Meanwhile, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro has highlighted AI investments from giants like Amazon, declaring Pennsylvania as a future hub for AI. Whitmer celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, which promises thousands of jobs, both in construction and high-skill positions.

Labor unions, particularly in the building trades, are also optimistic about the job opportunities AI could bring. Brent Booker from the Laborers' International Union of North America emphasizes the need for responsible planning, ensuring data centers are built with union labor and that energy supplies are expanded for affected communities.

On the other hand, progressive Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are more critical. They're pushing for robust government regulations to protect workers who might be displaced by AI. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders even called for a halt on constructing new data centers until regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez, while not explicitly supporting a moratorium, has stressed the public health risks of unregulated AI development.

That's the latest on the Democrats' AI debate as we head into the new year.

First up, let's talk about the impact of AI on jobs and communities. Concerns are growing that AI chatbots might be contributing to tragic outcomes for children and that AI data centers are driving up electricity costs and causing pollution. While some unions are warming up to AI, others are pushing back, fearing job losses. The Teamsters, for instance, are demanding that self-driving trucks still have human operators, a stance supported by some Democrats like Senator John Fetterman. However, not everyone is vocal on this issue, leaving some questions unanswered.

Next, let's dive into the financial outlook for AI. Wall Street remains optimistic about AI's future, despite some risks. Analysts argue that current stock valuations are justified, with companies like Nvidia being seen as undervalued given their growth potential. Even though tech stocks aren't rallying as they once did, this is viewed as a sign of a more selective and healthy market. Demand for AI is strong, evidenced by record user numbers for OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Meanwhile, concerns about data centers being overbuilt are being addressed by local officials who are starting to limit their growth. This is seen as a positive move that will naturally regulate the market. There's also significant spending on AI infrastructure, with tech firms investing heavily, which is seen as necessary for future growth.

Finally, the question of AI's profitability looms large. Monetization is expected to come through advertising and new product releases, with OpenAI likely leading the charge early next year. This could open up new revenue streams and solidify AI's role in the economy.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to expand its business reach. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer, signaling a push to engage more with enterprises. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the current excitement around AI might be a bubble ready to burst.

Next, the traditional rules of investing might not apply anymore. With the rapid changes brought by AI, strategists suggest it's time to rethink how markets operate.

Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is set to acquire Intersect, a data center firm, for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing demand for powerful infrastructure to support energy-intensive AI data centers.

Finally, AI is already having a significant impact on various aspects of life, including childhood. Concerns are rising as AI-powered surveillance cameras from Flock are reportedly accessible online without security measures like passwords, raising questions about safety and privacy.
