Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and the newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI update.

First up, there's a growing divide in the Democratic Party over the future of AI, setting the stage for the 2028 elections. As Democrats look to reclaim the White House, their stance on AI could have significant implications for the economy and workforce.

Here's the big picture: Within the Democratic Party, two main perspectives are emerging. Some argue that embracing AI is crucial to outpace China and secure jobs from AI companies building data centers. They feel the current administration is too lenient with AI firms. Others advocate for slowing down and imposing more regulations, concerned about AI's potential to displace millions of workers and its environmental impact.

Next, let's talk about the latest developments. Swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, both eyeing 2028, are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro has emphasized Pennsylvania's pivotal role in AI, while Whitmer celebrated a major OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs. Labor unions, particularly in construction, are also optimistic about the job opportunities AI could bring.

Meanwhile, some progressive Democrats, including New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California's Ro Khanna, are more critical of AI companies. They're pushing for strict regulations and policies to protect workers who might lose jobs to AI. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has even called for a halt on building new data centers until regulations are in place. Ocasio-Cortez, though not explicitly supporting a moratorium, highlighted the public health risks of unregulated AI during a recent congressional hearing.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates, and enjoy the holidays!

First up, there's growing concern around AI chatbots and their impact on children, with claims that they may contribute to tragic outcomes. Meanwhile, AI data centers are under fire for driving up electricity costs and causing pollution in local communities. While some unions are embracing AI, others are pushing back, fearing job losses. The Teamsters, for example, are demanding that self-driving trucks still have human operators, a stance supported by some Democrats like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, though not all have voiced their opinions.

Next, let's talk about the financial outlook for AI in 2026. Despite some declines in tech stocks, Wall Street remains optimistic, viewing these as healthy corrections. Concerns about high stock valuations are being downplayed, with analysts arguing that companies like Nvidia are actually undervalued given their expected growth. Nvidia, for instance, trades at a relatively low earnings ratio compared to past tech giants, suggesting room for growth.

Meanwhile, the demand for AI continues to rise, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reaching a record 800 million weekly users. Although there's talk of data centers being overbuilt, some see this as a positive, with local officials stepping in to manage growth. This intervention is seen as a natural market regulator.

Finally, there's debate over the massive spending on AI infrastructure. While top tech firms are investing heavily, some argue this is necessary for future growth. The expectation is that AI will eventually become profitable, likely through advertising and new product releases, with significant opportunities on the horizon.

First up, OpenAI is making moves to expand its reach in the business world. They've brought on former Slack CEO Denise Dresser as their chief revenue officer, signaling a strong push to sell more to enterprises. However, venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky warns that the AI bubble might be showing signs of bursting, despite efforts to spin things positively.

Next, the AI revolution is shaking up traditional market strategies. Experts suggest it's time to rethink old investing rules, as the landscape is rapidly changing with AI's influence.

Meanwhile, Google parent company Alphabet is set to acquire data center firm Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash. This move highlights the ongoing race among AI companies to secure the power needed for energy-intensive data centers.

Finally, AI's impact is reaching into unexpected areas, like childhood experiences and security. An investigation revealed that Flock's AI-powered surveillance cameras are live-streamed online without requiring a password or login, raising concerns about safety and privacy.
