First up, OpenAI is raising alarms about the cyber capabilities of its latest AI models. The company warns that these advancements could make it easier for more people to execute cyberattacks. Recent models have shown increased autonomy, which could lead to more brute force attacks. For instance, GPT-5 and its successor, GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, have demonstrated significant improvements in cybersecurity exercises. OpenAI is preparing for future models to reach high levels of cybersecurity capability, although they haven't specified when these might appear. The concern is that these models could work for extended periods, making certain attacks easier to defend against but still posing a risk. Other companies, like Anthropic, have also noted AI's role in automating cyber operations. OpenAI is stepping up its collaboration efforts across the industry to address these threats, including launching a Frontier Risk Council and developing tools like Aardvark to help developers find security vulnerabilities.

Next, Wall Street is gearing up for a potential $3 trillion IPO wave.

First up, some of the world's biggest startups, including two major AI players, are eyeing IPOs next year. These potential blockbuster offerings could create around $3 trillion in new public companies. However, there's a catch: many of these companies aren't profitable yet, reminiscent of the dot-com era's risky valuations. Elon Musk's SpaceX is planning to go public with a whopping $1.5 trillion valuation, aiming for the richest listing ever. OpenAI is also in the spotlight with an implied valuation of over $500 billion, sparking IPO speculation.

Next, other tech giants in AI, crypto, and frontier tech are considering IPOs in 2026. This includes OpenAI's competitor, Anthropic. With markets near record highs, investor enthusiasm for AI, space, and crypto is strong. But there's caution too. Investors are wary of a potential bubble in AI stocks, and any signs of weakness could make them nervous.

Meanwhile, Oracle's big investment in AI data centers didn't pay off as expected. Its shares dropped over 10% after disappointing quarterly results. Experts warn that if valuations get too high, we might see another WeWork scenario, where initial hype doesn't match reality. Sky-high valuations test how much speculative hope investors are willing to back in this AI-driven era.

Finally, not all IPOs will be winners. Some could underperform, while others might become the next big thing like Nvidia or Alphabet. A wave of IPOs could be positive, allowing everyday investors to share in corporate growth. And in lighter news, In-N-Out has quietly dropped order number 67 to avoid chaos among younger customers, while Arby's embraces the youthful energy.
