First up, OpenAI is raising alarms about its latest AI models, suggesting they could increase cyber risks. The company warns that future models might enable more people to launch cyberattacks due to their advanced capabilities. OpenAI's recent models, like GPT-5 and GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, have shown significant progress in tasks like capture-the-flag exercises, suggesting a trend toward greater cybersecurity capabilities. They're preparing for the possibility that new models could reach high-risk levels, though they haven't specified when this might happen. Despite the risks, these models are also becoming better at identifying security vulnerabilities, which can benefit both attackers and defenders. In response, OpenAI is ramping up efforts to collaborate on cybersecurity threats, launching initiatives like the Frontier Model Forum and the Frontier Risk Council. They're also testing a tool called Aardvark to help developers find security gaps in their products.
