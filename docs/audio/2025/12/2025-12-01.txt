First up, let's talk about ChatGPT turning three. It's been an intense few years since OpenAI released ChatGPT, and it's clear that AI is reshaping the workplace. It's boosting productivity for some, while others worry about being automated out of a job. As AI models improve, the focus shifts from fixing AI errors to guiding AI's work. The key skill now? Managing AI effectively. Researchers show AI can save time, but it can also lead to more work if not managed well. Business leaders say AI amplifies existing expertise, making it tough for new grads to stand out. As AI takes over certain tasks, it might devalue human skills, but it really depends on how we use it. According to Vasant Dhar, staying relevant in the AI age means having deep expertise, curiosity, and asking lots of questions. The future is uncertain, but humans and AI are moving forward together.

Next, let's explore how AI is affecting retirement planning. Many office workers who once relied on their skills to fund retirement are now seeing chatbots perform those tasks just as well, if not better. This shift adds to the anxiety around the AI boom, as people wonder about the security of their future.

First up, let's talk about AI's impact on retirement planning. While AI stocks like Nvidia are popular in 401(k)s, there's a warning that a market correction could affect retirement savings. On the flip side, AI can assist with retirement planning by offering tools for scenario modeling and tax optimization. However, experts caution against relying solely on AI, as it may not handle complex life events well. Combining AI with professional advice might be the best approach, especially during volatile markets.

Next, AI is revolutionizing holiday shopping. Retailers and tech giants are in an AI arms race, deploying smart shopping assistants to enhance the shopping experience. From product discovery to completing purchases, AI is set to transform this holiday season into the first true AI-driven shopping experience.

Meanwhile, Google's latest TPU chip is making waves in the tech world, challenging Nvidia's dominance. Alibaba's new Qwen model excels at finding specific details in long videos, outperforming some recent models from Google and OpenAI. DeepSeek has also released a model that promises top-notch results on math tests.

Finally, a fun fact to wrap things up: crows are known to hold grudges.
