First up, young professionals are pushing for more personalized AI at work. A new survey reveals that almost all young knowledge workers use AI, but they want it to better match their personal writing and speaking styles. This demand for customization highlights how the youngest in the workforce are often early adopters of technology, signaling where trends might head next. According to the survey by Google Workspace and Harris Poll, a staggering 92% of young leaders want AI that integrates seamlessly with their personal data, like emails and meeting notes, to enhance productivity. As Yulie Kwon Kim from Google Workspace points out, the expectations for AI have risen—what was once a novelty now needs to be genuinely useful and personalized.

Next, let's talk about a breakthrough in geothermal energy. Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals has announced a significant discovery in western Nevada, aided by AI. This is the first commercially viable geothermal system found in over 30 years. The discovery is a promising sign that geothermal energy could play a key role in meeting the growing energy demands in the U.S. AI's role in this discovery underscores its potential in advancing energy solutions.

First up, let's talk about geothermal energy. It's one of those rare alternative energy sources that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on. Democrats love its zero-emissions benefits, while Republicans appreciate its potential for providing consistent power. 

Next, there's some exciting news from Nevada. A site called Big Blind, which had no visible signs of geothermal activity, has been identified as a hotspot. Thanks to Zanskar scientists and their AI tools, they pinpointed a geothermal anomaly that promises high heat flow. This tech-driven approach means fewer costly mistakes when drilling wells, as explained by Zanskar's co-founder, Joel Edwards.

Meanwhile, Zanskar's CEO, Carl Hoiland, highlighted the role of AI in helping them dig deeper and more accurately, much like advancements in other natural resource industries. Their success at Big Blind follows previous work at known geothermal sites in Nevada and New Mexico, which hadn't been fully explored until now.

Looking ahead, Zanskar plans to develop Big Blind into a commercial power source by the end of the decade. The International Energy Agency sees geothermal meeting a significant chunk of global power demand growth by 2050, but it will need more government support and skilled labor to get there. 

Finally, on the policy front, geothermal energy has strong backing from Congress and the previous administration. Energy Secretary Chris Wright called it an "awesome resource" that could power future innovations. Despite cuts to other renewable energy tax credits, geothermal incentives remain intact, signaling a promising future for this energy source.

Switching gears, let's touch on some tech industry updates. Memory giant Micron is shifting focus away from consumer products to support AI data centers. Meanwhile, Meta has recruited Alan Dye from Apple to lead a new lab aimed at blending design, fashion, and tech. OpenAI is expanding its capabilities by acquiring Neptune, a Polish startup that enhances AI model training. And in the business world, Salesforce reported strong earnings, though Snowflake's profit outlook fell short of expectations.

First up, 1980s pop sensation Tiffany is back in the spotlight. Her classic hit "I Think We're Alone Now" is gaining new fans after being featured in the latest season of Stranger Things. It's now the most searched-for track on Shazam.
