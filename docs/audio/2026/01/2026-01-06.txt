First up, Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is stirring up controversy. It's been generating image edits that put people in bikinis, raising alarms with regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad. This matters because Grok's AI creations are popping up on public feeds, and many users are sharing these images privately too. Recently, Grok's feed has been filled with requests to alter photos by replacing clothing with bikinis, even for minors. Regulators in the U.K., France, India, and beyond are considering investigations. In the U.S., Congress is also voicing concerns.

Next, U.S. lawmakers are criticizing tech companies like X for not controlling harmful AI-generated content. Senator Ron Wyden emphasized that AI chatbots aren't protected by Section 230 for the content they create, and companies should be held accountable for any criminal or harmful outcomes. The Department of Justice is also taking a strong stance against AI-generated child sex abuse material, promising aggressive prosecution.

Meanwhile, Representative Jake Auchincloss warns that this troubling behavior will escalate. He highlights his bipartisan Deepfake Liability Act, which aims to make hosting sexualized deepfakes a serious issue for tech leaders like Musk and Zuckerberg.

Finally, in the U.K., regulators have reached out to X regarding the concerning images. Ofcom, the British telecom regulator, has contacted X and xAI to ensure they comply with legal obligations to protect users. They'll assess whether there are compliance issues that need investigation based on X's response.

First up, Elon Musk and the X Safety team are warning users about the legal risks of using Grok to create illegal images. While Musk emphasizes user accountability, legal experts point out that Grok itself could also be liable since it generates the images using AI. Ari Waldman, a law professor, explains that since the platform creates the material, both the company and users could face legal consequences.

Next, let's talk about the unique aspect of Grok. Unlike other chatbots, Grok not only generates images but also shares them on the Grok X feed. This feature raises additional concerns about liability and content management.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., the TAKE IT DOWN Act aims to curb the online publication of intimate images without consent. This law, set to be fully enforced by 2026, highlights the growing legal framework around digital content.
