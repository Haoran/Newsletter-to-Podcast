Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and this newsletter will return to your inbox on Monday, January 5th. Let's dive into today's topics.

First up, the Democratic Party is facing a split over AI policy as we look toward 2028. The future of AI is becoming a major point of contention among party hopefuls and leaders, setting the stage for a significant policy battle in the primaries.

Why does this matter? If Democrats reclaim the White House in 2028, their stance on AI will influence how the U.S. navigates this transformative technology, impacting the economy and workforce significantly.

Here's the big picture: Within the Democratic Party, two main arguments are emerging. Some advocate for embracing AI to compete with China and seize job opportunities from new data centers. They argue this approach mirrors the Trump administration's, though many Democrats feel the current White House is too lenient with AI companies. On the other hand, some Democrats urge caution, calling for more regulation due to AI's potential to displace workers and its environmental impact from resource-intensive data centers.

Next, let's look at the latest developments. Swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro has declared Pennsylvania a future AI hub, aiming to outpace China. He's highlighted investments from companies like Amazon. Meanwhile, Whitmer announced a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of construction and high-skill jobs. Labor unions, especially in the building trades, are partnering with the AI industry, seeing potential job growth for their members. Brent Booker, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, emphasizes the need for responsible planning and union labor in constructing these data centers, alongside expanding energy supplies for affected communities.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates when we return in January.

First up, some progressive Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are voicing strong concerns about AI companies. They're pushing for major government regulations to safeguard workers who might lose jobs to technology. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders even suggested halting the construction of data centers driving the rapid AI growth. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't explicitly supported a moratorium but highlighted serious public health concerns linked to unregulated AI, noting impacts like increased electricity costs and community pollution.

Meanwhile, the response to AI from unions is mixed. While some are open to it, others fear job losses. The Teamsters are demanding that all self-driving trucks include a human operator, leading to a potential showdown with AI firms. Some Democrats, like Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, are backing the union's stance, though others remain silent. When asked about his position, Governor Shapiro's spokesperson didn't comment.
