First up, let's talk about the race in AI model development. While AI is the buzzword of today and tomorrow, success isn't just about having the best model. Timing is crucial. Box CEO Aaron Levie emphasizes that winners will know when to deploy technology and how to integrate it into complex organizations without wasting resources. Winston Weinberg from Harvey adds that good AI should understand context without needing lengthy explanations. Levie also notes that even with improved models, there's still a lot of groundwork needed before tasks become automated.

Next, let's dive between the lines. Levie points out that while coding workflows can be streamlined, knowledge work is far messier. Improved AI models could soon make agents a reality, with Fidji Simo from OpenAI predicting that in a year, AI will do more than just answer questions. We'll have AI assistants anticipating our needs and making decisions for us.

Meanwhile, looking ahead to 2026, Dan Rogers from Asana believes successful companies will set ambitious goals that only AI can achieve. Ryan Gavin from Slack foresees a year dominated by "lonely agents," with companies creating numerous agents per employee, many of which will remain unused.

Finally, AT&T's Andy Markus highlights the challenge of agentic solutions: they require accuracy at every step to be effective. Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures sums it up by calling 2026 the "show me the money" year for AI. Enterprises will demand real returns on investment, and countries will look for productivity gains to justify AI spending. Gavin concludes that the most valuable agents will seamlessly integrate into work environments, understanding context and functioning effortlessly.
