Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and the newsletter will return on Monday, January 5th. 

First up, let's talk about a growing divide within the Democratic Party over AI policy, which is already shaping the 2028 political landscape. As potential presidential candidates and party leaders take sides, this debate could significantly influence how the U.S. handles AI if Democrats regain the White House.

Here's why it matters: The party's stance on AI will have major implications for the economy and the workforce. On one hand, some Democrats argue for embracing AI to compete with China and secure jobs from the data centers AI companies are building. This approach mirrors the Trump administration's stance, though Democrats criticize it for being too lenient with AI firms.

Meanwhile, others in the party advocate for slowing down and imposing more regulations. They worry about AI's potential to displace workers and the environmental impact of energy-hungry data centers.

Next, let's look at the latest developments. Swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer are welcoming AI investments. Shapiro, eyeing a potential 2028 run, has declared Pennsylvania as a future AI hub, aiming to outpace China. He's highlighted investments from companies like Amazon.

Meanwhile, Whitmer has celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, which promises thousands of jobs and significant economic benefits. Labor unions, particularly in the construction sector, are on board, seeing AI as a source of new employment opportunities. Brent Booker, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, emphasizes the need for responsible planning and union labor in building these data centers, ensuring they benefit local communities.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates when we return in January.

First up, some progressive Democrats are voicing concerns about AI's rapid growth. Figures like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are pushing for stronger government regulations to protect workers at risk of being displaced by AI technology. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is even calling for a pause on building data centers fueling AI development.

Next, Ocasio-Cortez has highlighted potential public health issues due to the lack of AI regulation. She points out that AI chatbots have been linked to tragic events among children and that data centers are driving up electricity costs and harming local environments.

Meanwhile, the labor movement is divided on AI. Some unions are embracing it, while others, like the Teamsters, are fighting back. They demand that self-driving trucks always have a human operator, a stance that has found support from some Democrats, including Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman. However, others remain silent on the issue.
