Happy holidays, everyone! Ina and this newsletter will be back on January 5th. Now, let's dive into today's AI update.

First up, there's a growing divide within the Democratic Party over the future of AI, which is already shaping the 2028 primary landscape. This debate could significantly influence how the U.S. approaches AI if Democrats regain the White House in 2028, impacting both the economy and workforce.

Here's the big picture: Democrats are split into two camps. One side argues for embracing AI to compete with China and secure jobs from the data centers AI companies are building. This view aligns somewhat with the Trump administration's stance, though Democrats criticize the current administration for being too lenient with AI companies. On the other side, some Democrats urge caution, advocating for more regulation due to AI's potential to displace workers and its environmental impact.

Meanwhile, swing state governors like Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, both eyeing 2028 presidential runs, are welcoming AI companies. Shapiro has positioned Pennsylvania as a future AI hub, emphasizing competition with China. Whitmer celebrated a massive OpenAI project in Michigan, promising thousands of jobs and significant economic benefits. Labor unions, particularly in construction, are also on board, seeing opportunities for their members. Brent Booker of the Laborers' International Union of North America emphasizes the need for responsible planning, ensuring data centers are built with union labor and consider community energy needs.

That's all for now. Stay tuned for more updates, and enjoy the holiday season!

First up, some progressive Democrats are voicing concerns about the rapid development of AI. Figures like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna are pushing for strong government regulations to protect workers potentially displaced by AI technology. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders even suggested halting the construction of data centers fueling AI growth. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted potential public health risks and environmental impacts, such as increased electricity costs and pollution. 

Next, the conversation around AI is also stirring debate among unions. Some unions are warming up to AI, but others, like the Teamsters, are pushing back. They're demanding that self-driving trucks still include human operators, which is causing tension with AI companies. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman supports these union demands, though other Democrats remain silent on the issue.
