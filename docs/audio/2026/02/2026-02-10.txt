First up, AI infighting has reached a boiling point. CEOs in the AI industry are publicly criticizing each other, especially over advertising strategies and their visions for the future. This matters because the competition in AI is getting more expensive, and there's pressure for these technologies to start showing real results. The tension escalated during the Super Bowl when Anthropic promised to keep its AI model, Claude, ad-free and took a jab at OpenAI, which is experimenting with ads in ChatGPT. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, responded with a lengthy online post, calling the ad misleading. Meanwhile, Altman is also dealing with rumors about OpenAI's ties with Nvidia after reports suggested Nvidia might be backing out of a significant investment. OpenAI is reportedly looking for chip alternatives. Adding to the drama, Altman and Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, are in the middle of legal disputes and public disagreements. This rivalry highlights a broader divide in the AI world between those who see AI as a careful, long-term project and those who want rapid progress. Despite the chaos, some argue that this competitive spirit is good for the economy. Ultimately, the success of AI might rely more on the technology itself than on its leaders.

Next, former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke is stepping into the AI coding arena with a new startup. This venture focuses on a future where AI agents handle most coding tasks. Automated coding has been a standout success in generative AI, but it's a crowded field with many startups and major players like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft.

First up, Entire, a new company, has secured $60 million in a seed funding round, valuing it at $300 million. Leading the investment were Felicis, Madrona, Microsoft's M12, and Basis Set, with notable individual investors like Gergely Orosz and former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang. Entire is launching its first product, Checkpoints, designed for developers to track the context of AI-written code, including prompts and decisions made by AI agents.

Next, Entire's CEO, Dohmke, shared that their platform is meant for the new era where AI writes most of the code. He emphasized that Entire isn't about training AI models but integrating with them, offering an open-source, scalable platform for developers. Dohmke, who recently left his role at GitHub, aims to provide a home for developers using various AI coding tools, without directly competing with them.

Meanwhile, the landscape of software development is shifting. Dohmke predicts that soon, developers won't review code as much, as AI agents will handle more of the coding process. He suggests a need to rethink software production, envisioning an "agent assembly line" for development.

Finally, in related news, a cofounder of Elon Musk's xAI has resigned. The software industry is facing what some call a "SaaS-pocalypse," as AI transforms the software-as-a-service sector. New research indicates AI doesn't necessarily reduce workload but can intensify it. Additionally, AI medical tools are reportedly more likely to provide incorrect advice if misinformation seems to come from authoritative sources.
