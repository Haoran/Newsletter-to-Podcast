First up, Hollywood is facing a new challenge from China's AI advancements. Chinese AI models, like ByteDance's Seedance 2.0, are generating hyperrealistic videos that have Hollywood on edge. These models are cheaper and faster, but they lack the safety measures around copyrights and likeness rights. Major studios like Netflix and Disney have already sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance, claiming infringement. Despite legal pressure, Chinese AI models are gaining ground, with their use skyrocketing over the past year. The big question is whether Hollywood can curb China's AI momentum.

Next, the AI boom might soon hit your wallet, especially if you're in the market for a new TV. The surge in AI technology is driving up the price of RAM and memory chips, which are crucial for making smart TVs. Industry experts warn that this could lead to higher prices and fewer TVs on the market. Companies like Samsung are already hinting at potential price hikes due to these shortages. With TVs relying on these chips to run apps and process data, the impact on production and pricing could be significant.

First up, let's talk about the memory market. It might not seem critical for TVs, but just like chips became essential for cars, memory is becoming crucial due to AI. AI companies are rapidly consuming memory supplies, and this demand is likely to continue. Marco Mezger from Neumonda explains that as memory tightens, prices rise, product launches shift, and smaller companies struggle more than tech giants. While we won't see empty shelves immediately, if AI demand keeps up, consumers might feel the impact in six to twelve months. TrendForce reports that rising memory and panel costs are already pushing TV production costs higher, and retail prices are expected to jump this year.

Next, let's consider how Americans typically react to such changes. Historically, even when consumer goods are scarce or pricier, like during the pandemic or the Great Recession, people adapt. TV sales, for instance, remained strong despite shortages and price hikes because people turned to at-home entertainment when other options were too costly.

Meanwhile, AI demand is reshaping the memory market, and TV buyers could soon feel the effects.

Finally, shifting gears to the sports world, the quarterfinal men's hockey matches were nail-biters, with both the U.S. and Canada needing overtime to advance. While I missed those games, I did enjoy some exciting short-track speedskating and gained a new appreciation for the skill involved.
