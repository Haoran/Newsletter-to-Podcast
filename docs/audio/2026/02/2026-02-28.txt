First up, let's talk about the AI race and Anthropic's Claude. Just two months into 2026, Claude is making waves by shaking up U.S. national security, financial markets, and the startup scene. Anthropic is now reconsidering its strict safety commitments, a big shift for a company known for its ethical stance. This change comes as the Pentagon debates Claude's role in military applications.

Next, Anthropic's rise is impressive. Once a little-known startup, it's now valued at $380 billion, having just raised $30 billion from major investors. Claude is praised for its complex reasoning and reliability, standing out among competitors.

Meanwhile, OpenAI is gearing up to release ChatGPT 5.3, also known as "Garlic," in response to pressure from Google. But the real wildcard is China's DeepSeek V4 model, which could shake up U.S. markets once again.

Zooming out, Claude's influence spans across key areas of American power. In Washington, Anthropic is in a tense debate with the Pentagon over Claude's potential use in surveillance and autonomous weapons. The Pentagon sees Claude as the top performer, making any replacement costly and challenging.

On Wall Street, Claude's updates have led to significant market fluctuations, dubbed the "SaaSpocalypse." Recent releases have caused major stock value drops, with companies like Thomson Reuters and LegalZoom taking hits. However, some firms are bouncing back by forming new partnerships with Claude.

First up, let's talk about Claude Code. It's creating a buzz in Silicon Valley. Venture capitalists and engineers are excited about its potential to drive a new wave of AI-native startups. This excitement is putting pressure on OpenAI, which recently launched a competing app called Codex. The real test for Claude will be whether it can live up to its promise of being the safest and best AI.

Next, we have some breaking news from the Pentagon. They're considering blacklisting Anthropic, the company behind Claude. This move is significant because such penalties are usually reserved for foreign companies like Huawei. The Pentagon is reaching out to major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin to assess their reliance on Claude. This is unprecedented, especially since Claude is currently the only AI model used in the military's classified systems.

Meanwhile, there's tension between Anthropic and the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic's CEO a deadline to agree to the Pentagon's terms. If not, the Pentagon might use the Defense Production Act to force changes or declare the company a supply chain risk.

Finally, even CEOs are feeling the heat from AI. In a recent survey, Fortune 500 CEOs ranked AI as the top risk to their industries. This is surprising because many of these leaders have been strong supporters of new technology. Companies like Microsoft and Amazon have seen stock fluctuations, partly due to AI's impact. It's a reminder that AI is reshaping industries in unexpected ways.
