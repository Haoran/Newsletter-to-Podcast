First up, let's talk about the role of AI in this year's Winter Olympics. It's not just about the athletes; AI is transforming how the games are organized, broadcasted, and experienced by fans worldwide. 

AI's biggest impact might not be flashy, but it's crucial. Managing the logistics of a global event like the Olympics, especially with unpredictable winter weather, requires precision. AI helps with rapid contingency planning, ensuring everything runs smoothly without a hitch.

Next, AI is enhancing how we watch the games. It's automating highlight reels, allowing fans to access clips of their favorite performances instantly. In sports where every fraction of a point counts, AI-assisted video analysis is helping judges make more accurate decisions, like checking figure skating rotations.

Meanwhile, AI is breaking down language barriers. Samsung is providing volunteers with AI translation phones, ensuring communication flows smoothly even in remote areas with poor cell service. This makes it easier for everyone to connect, regardless of language.

Finally, AI is crunching the massive amounts of data generated during the Olympics. Omega, the official timekeeper, and Alibaba Cloud are using AI models to make sense of performance and operational data, potentially changing how broadcasters and committees access and use this information.

In essence, AI is not just showing us the Olympics; it's helping us understand and appreciate the sports, even if we're not die-hard fans. This evolution in coverage is making the games more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

First up, during the first week of the Games, Exarchos emphasized the importance of using technology meaningfully, focusing on athletes rather than just showcasing tech. Looking ahead, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics plans to leverage AI for designing a transit-first event in the car-centric city, tackling transportation challenges akin to the precision needed in gymnastics.

Next, Meta is making waves by investing tens of billions in Nvidia AI chips, boosting both companies' shares. This massive purchase includes millions of Nvidia's latest chips for Meta's U.S. data centers, marking a shift towards using AI for inference rather than training. This move highlights the high demand for computing power, especially as hyperscalers are projected to spend $650 billion on data centers this year.

Meanwhile, Anthropic is rolling out Claude Sonnet 4.6, its new AI model with enhanced coding and computer skills. This update narrows the gap between premium and free offerings, making advanced features more accessible. Sonnet 4.6 excels in real-world office tasks and coding, offering smarter, faster solutions without the need for premium models.

Finally, a new Senate bill is sparking debate over whether data centers' energy costs should be passed to consumers. This discussion is drawing attention from both AI and energy sectors, each weighing the potential impacts of such a policy.

First up, there's a new measure in the works aimed at protecting consumers from rate hikes due to data centers. This initiative also ensures that any new data centers will draw power from sources not connected to the main grid.

Next, Apple is ramping up its efforts in AI wearables. They're working on smart glasses, a pendant, and new AirPods. However, AI model research is struggling to keep pace with these advancements.

Meanwhile, in the world of figure skating, Amber Glenn recently performed in Milan's short program. Her routine was stunning, but she missed a required element, placing her in 13th as she heads into the free skate.
